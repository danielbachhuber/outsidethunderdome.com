<p>Award-winning journalist MaryJo Webster <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/28/maryjo-webster-thunderdome-data-team/" target="_blank">recently joined</a> Thunderdome’s data team as our new senior data reporter, bringing with her years of experience in analytical and investigative reporting. She joins us from the <a href="http://pioneerpress.com/" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>, where she was the computer-assisted reporting editor since 2005.</p>
<p>In addition to being an expert on Minnesota’s public records law, MaryJo also teaches a data journalism class at the University of Minnesota. Her work has been both excellent and prolific, winning her two DFMies in 2012 for <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/pioneer-press/pioneer-press-homerun-project-wins-data-journalism-dfmie/" target="_blank">data journalism</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/pioneer-press-examination-public-pension-spiking-wins-investigative-journalism-dfmie/" target="_blank">investigative reporting</a>.</p>
<p>What new and exciting things can you expect to see from the Thunderdome data team with the addition of MaryJo? We asked her to share some of her background as well as prospective projects, plus tips on reporting and her favorite thing to do in the Twin Cities.</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Lives in</strong>: Arden Hills, Minn. (a suburb of St. Paul)<br />
<strong>Hometown</strong>: Kasson, Minn.<br />
<strong>Graduated from: </strong>University of Missouri-Columbia, University of Wisconsin-River Falls<br />
<strong>Degree(s)</strong>: Masters and Bachelors in journalism<br />
<strong>Previous employers</strong>: St. Paul Pioneer Press, USA Today, Center for Public Integrity, Investigative Reporters and Editors, Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern, New Ulm (Minn.) Journal</p>
<h2><strong>On the job</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What will you be doing in your new role?</strong><br />
I will be spearheading national, data-driven stories — doing reporting, data analysis, writing and/or project management, as needed. These could be stories developed by local reporters at one or more of the DFM newsrooms, or it might be something developed from Thunderdome, or it might be projects that other organizations (such as ProPublica or the Center for Investigative Reporting) are sharing with DFM. In addition, I&#8217;ll be conducting virtual or in-person training sessions on a variety of data journalism topics, for DFM reporters and editors.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of projects do you plan to tackle?</strong><br />
Anything! I especially love education and environment issues, but the stories that could be done in this job are truly endless.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is “computer-assisted reporting”? Isn’t most reporting computer-assisted these days?</strong><br />
Yes, the term &#8220;computer-assisted reporting&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to fit anymore, and increasingly it&#8217;s being called &#8220;data journalism.&#8221; Computer-assisted reporting (CAR) got its name in the early 1990s when desktop computers were still quite new to journalism and the Internet didn&#8217;t exist. Interestingly, even back then there were people who didn&#8217;t think this was the right name. The debate crops up among data journalists pretty much every year! Whatever you call it, the definition is the same. It&#8217;s a set of skills that enable journalists to do their own analysis of data, rather than solely relying on public officials or non-profit organizations. In the past decade, that skillset has broadened to include making data accessible online for readers to explore, either through interactive maps, graphics or searchable databases.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into investigative journalism?<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve had a passion for watchdog-type stories ever since I learned about the Washington Post&#8217;s reporting on Watergate, when I was a teenager. So, early in my career I looked for ways to get into a job that would allow me to do that full-time. After five years as a beat reporter at small daily newspapers, I found that data journalism skills would be the best way to get there.</p>
<p><strong>What are some stories you’ve done that you are proudest of?<br />
</strong>There are lots. But here are three:</p>
<p>When I was at USA Today, I wanted to measure whether it was true that high schools in more affluent neighborhoods/communities earned more state championship trophies than schools in less affluent areas. We spent months collecting lists of state championship winners from 13 states that we picked as a representative sample of the U.S. Then we matched that to various measures of income for the schools and the neighborhoods they were located in. The resulting analysis showed that the more affluent schools won state championships at twice the rate of those in the least affluent areas. <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2004-06-17-titles-1a-cover_x.htm">The story is still online,</a> if you&#8217;d like to read it.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Also while at the Pioneer Press, one of the suburbs of St. Paul started talking about imposing restrictions on where certain sex offenders could live in the city. The restrictions would require them to stay a certain distance away from things like schools, daycare facilities, parks, places of worship and bus stops. I plotted those places (except the bus stops) onto a map using ArcGIS mapping software, then added the restriction zones. The resulting map showed the proposed ordinance would effectively force these sex offenders out of the city. The only places not covered by a restricted zone were under a major freeway or in an industrial park. A few days after our story (and the map) published, the city council tabled the measure and has not brought it up again. Unfortunately, this story isn&#8217;t online anymore.</span></p>
<p>During my last year at the Pioneer Press, I spent a lot of time covering public pension issues in Minnesota. Getting up to speed on how pensions work was incredibly difficult. I think it easily took six months of reading and re-reading material and asking lots of questions before I understood it well enough to write <a href="http://www.twincities.com/pensions/ci_22405432/minnesota-theres-what-pensions-promise-then-theres-what" target="_blank">this story about the financial footing of Minnesota&#8217;s public pensions</a>, plus several other related stories. It was especially rewarding to get compliments from both pension experts and general readers about how well I had done explaining such a difficult topic.</p>
<p><strong>What role does data reporting play in journalism now, and how do you see it changing? Is it more or less prominent than before?</strong><br />
Data journalism is increasingly becoming a core necessity in newsrooms. Nearly all of the information reporters seek from government offices is stored in a database or spreadsheet. And news organizations are seeking more opportunities to share data with readers, either through interactive maps/graphics or searchable databases. Both of these aspects require staff members to have at least basic data skills.</p>
<p><strong>What skills do you teach students in your “Database Reporting” course?</strong><br />
I teach a combination of the thought process that goes into analyzing data, along with specific skills in various types of software. We analyze data in a spreadsheet program and a database manager, use various tools for cleaning inconsistent data and then also learn some basic tools for creating online graphics and maps. The underlying message that flows throughout the entire course is the idea that data is a source. Much like your human sources, it can tell you the wrong answer if you don&#8217;t ask the right question. And it can give you some answers, but also often leads you to more questions.</p>
<p><strong>What are some important do’s and don’ts for aspiring data reporters?</strong><br />
The most important thing to do is to practice, practice, practice. Learning how to do data analysis is like learning a foreign language. It takes some work to reach fluency.</p>
<p>On the flip side, don&#8217;t set out trying to do a really big, complex analysis/investigation on your first go-around. Find a small, relatively benign story to tackle first. Then work your way up.</p>
<p><strong>What’s some background that others probably don’t know about you?</strong><br />
I had almost zero knowledge of sports statistics when I took the job at the USA Today sports department. At one point when we were getting an insanely huge database from the PGA, I had to go to the golf editor and ask him to explain the game so I could understand the data. He very nicely pulled out a piece of paper, started drawing and said, &#8220;This is the fairway. This is the green &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How will you be splitting your time between Minnesota and New York?</strong><br />
Mostly I&#8217;ll be camped out at my home office, but will try to make at least a couple visits a year to the New York office. With this being a new position that no one has ever tackled before, it&#8217;s hard to say how we will operate.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a great data resource you think more journalists should know about/utilize?</strong><br />
The <a href="http://ire.org/nicar/">database library</a> at the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (an affiliate of Investigative Reporters and Editors). They obtain, clean up and then make available (at a small fee) to reporters dozens of national datasets. Many of them are either difficult or time-consuming to obtain, or require a bit too much cleanup for the average reporter to do themselves. The staff will also do analysis for a news organization (for a fee) .</p>
<h2>Real talk</h2>
<p><strong>Why journalism?</strong><br />
I want to hold public officials accountable for how they spend our money.</p>
<p><strong>Do you subscribe to any print publications?</strong><br />
The St. Paul Pioneer Press, The New Yorker, Women&#8217;s Health and Parents. Although I must confess that I&#8217;m starting to read the New Yorker on my iPad. It&#8217;s handy having them all in one place, especially since they pile up on me and I usually have 2 or 3 months&#8217; worth at a time to read.</p>
<p><strong>What would happen if you were disconnected from the Internet and your phone for 48 hours?</strong><br />
I would probably have some withdrawal-type symptoms, worried that I&#8217;m missing some important email. But as long as my kids were with me (so I could physically make sure they&#8217;re okay), I think I would get by. My husband, on the other hand, would be freaking out and trying to figure out how he could fix it.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have unfettered access to the documents of any company or organization in the world, which would you choose?</strong><br />
Good question. I think I would choose the Pentagon. I think there are far too many secrets — or at least things that are not routinely published — about how the military operates and, more importantly, spends our money.</p>
<p><strong>What was the first thing you read this morning?</strong><br />
My email. Beyond that, I can&#8217;t remember.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your all-time favorite sports team?</strong><br />
Minnesota Vikings. I spent so many Sundays as a child, sitting with my father, watching the Purple People Eaters and asking him a million questions about the game. I still remember being so excited to go to summer training camp, where I got Tommy Kramer&#8217;s autograph.</p>
<p><strong>If you could interview any historical figure, who would it be?</strong><br />
Probably one of the legislators who helped craft the Bill of Rights. I&#8217;d love to try to answer that question that the Supreme Court always wrestles with: &#8220;What exactly did they mean by this?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What’s for lunch today?</strong><br />
Homemade chili.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your go-to karaoke song?</strong><br />
I haven&#8217;t done karaoke in at least 20 years!</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve lived in a number of Midwestern cities — which one wins your heart?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t know that I can come up with a particular city. But I can safely say that the Twin Cities is truly an awesome place. Yes, everybody knows us for the bitter cold and tons of snow (especially this year). But there&#8217;s something about the people here — it&#8217;s more than just the &#8220;Minnesota Nice&#8221; that we&#8217;re known for. People tend to be hardworking, willing to help anyone at the drop of a hat, and committed to taking care of the world around us.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite thing to do in the Twin Cities?</strong><br />
Go to my family cabin. And BTW, you aren&#8217;t considered a true Minnesotan until your family has a cabin &#8220;up north.&#8221; Mine has been in my family since 1937 — even before my mother was born. And I love watching my children learn to love it as much as I do.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">What book has had the greatest impact on you?<br />
</strong>The &#8220;Poisonwood Bible&#8221; by Barbara Kingsolver. Fabulous book.</p>
<p><strong>Name someone we should all follow on Twitter right now.</strong><br />
Instead of a person, I&#8217;m going to recommend you track the hashtag, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nicar14" target="_blank">#NICAR14</a>, for the next few days (through March 2). There will be a deluge of tweets from the <a href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/">National CAR Conference</a> that is being held in Baltimore.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/mandyspungeheadshot-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="mandyspungeheadshot" /></p><p>After several months of searching for the right person, it turns out that Thunderdome&#8217;s would-be managing editor was right here all along. That right person is our very own <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a>, who has played a crucial role building Thunderdome from the ground up.</p>
<p>Of course, Mandy is no stranger to Digital First Media newsrooms. Or to the larger digital media world, for that matter. After stints at <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/mandy-jenkins-joins-us-as-social-media-producer/" target="_blank">TBD</a> and the <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/media-lab/social-media/161798/mandy-jenkins-leaves-young-persons-job-of-social-media-editor/" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/digital-first-media-names-four-journalists-to-engagement-team/" target="_blank">she joined DFM in 2012</a>, taking on a variety of tasks that included newsroom training and development of the <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/socialwire/" target="_blank">Social Media Wire</a> tool now used widely across DFM sites. She also sits on the <a href="http://journalists.org/about/board-of-directors/" target="_blank">board of directors for the Online News Association</a> alongside fellow DFM-ers <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jbradysp" target="_blank">Jim Brady</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome/author/kbui" target="_blank">Kim Bui</a>.</p>
<p>But why does Thunderdome need a managing editor, and what will Mandy bring to the position? We asked her a few questions about the new gig, her background, her recent move to New York, and of course, karaoke. Here&#8217;s what our new managing editor has to say for herself:</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p><strong>Lives in</strong>: Long Island City, Queens<br />
<strong>Hometown</strong>: Zanesville, Ohio<br />
<strong>Graduated from</strong>: Kent State University<br />
<strong>Degree(s)</strong>: B.S. in News, M.A. in Media Management<br />
<strong>Previous work</strong>: The Huffington Post, TBD, The Cincinnati Enquirer, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and WKSU-FM.</p>
<h1>So you&#8217;re Thunderdome&#8217;s managing editor, eh?</h1>
<p><strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/03/qa-meet-thunderdomes-managing-editor-mandy-jenkins/mandyspungeheadshot/" rel="attachment wp-att-6489"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6489" alt="Photo/Alyson Aliano" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/mandyspungeheadshot-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Q: You&#8217;re Thunderdome&#8217;s very first managing editor. Tell us about this new role and what you intend to bring to it.</strong><br />
This is a role I think Thunderdome has grown to need &#8211; the newsroom is a lot bigger than it used to be and there are a lot of people and projects to track. My role is to manage the daily newsroom operations of Thunderdome, which includes supervising the news, features, sports and social media teams. I try to be a problem solver, so my first mission will be to improve our workflow to make it easier for all of the Thunderdome teams to more easily work together.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does this new role mean for other Digital First Media newsrooms? </strong><br />
As Thunderdome grows and improves, the stories and projects we create for and with our colleagues at the local level will also improve. We have a lot of interesting ideas we want to try with storytelling in the coming months and I hope I can help make that come about faster and easier. This new team alignment will also make it possible to expand our social media and community engagement efforts with local newsrooms. Stay tuned on that front.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Before this promotion, you were Thunderdome&#8217;s interactives editor. What happens to that position now that you&#8217;re vacating it? </strong><br />
In the short term, the interactives team, consisting of video, data journalism and design, will report to Robyn Tomlin directly. In the longer term, we may be doing some further reorganization as it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Showoff time: What are some of your proudest accomplishments from your time leading the interactives team? </strong><br />
This is an easy one. I am most proud of the people I hired on to this team &#8211; all of them are superheroes. Out of all the fabulous work they do, it&#8217;s tough to pick a favorite project: I love the local <a href="http://crime.denverpost.com/?source=hot-topic-bar">crime maps</a>, <a href="http://www.bracketadvisor.com/">Bracket Advisor</a>, the <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/guns/">Firearms in the Family project</a>, <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/kitchenpop/">KitchenPop</a>&#8230;it&#8217;s like asking me to choose between my cats.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share a lesson you learned while leading the interactives team.</strong><br />
Honestly? I learned in working with these guys just how much work and time goes in to making a great multimedia project. I came up through words on screens &#8211; I had no idea just what goes into making the beautiful things you can find on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You  joined Digital First Media in 2012, before there was a Thunderdome. What first drew you to DFM, and what&#8217;s kept you here all this time?</strong><br />
I have a very strong attachment to local news. I was enjoying my brief stint in national news at HuffPost,  but I felt like I could do more for the industry by helping build up local newsrooms. Also, I&#8217;ll be accused of being a suck-up, but I also really wanted a chance to work with Jim Brady again following our brief time at TBD.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You spent your first several months at DFM traveling around to local newsrooms. Do you have a favorite?</strong><br />
I really loved going to local newsrooms and spending time in those communities. It&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite place, but I do have a favorite story. When I was visiting the Vacaville newsroom in NorCal, I was held hostage in the building by an angry wild turkey. When I eventually made a break for it, he chased me to my car and aggressively pecked at my side door until I left. I&#8217;m very afraid of birds, so that was serious nightmare fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s some background that others probably don&#8217;t know about you?</strong><br />
I have held some seriously random jobs over high school and college, including: Camp cook, fast food drone, computer salesperson, wild goose wrangler (long story), pet store puppy caregiver, Hallmark associate, roofing assistant, fitness instructor, comics shop nerd whisperer&#8230;.it goes on.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You&#8217;ve taught journalism and led training for people all around the globe. What makes for a good teacher?</strong><br />
Understanding the roadblocks facing students and addressing them head-on is key to a successful workshop or class. I get that newsrooms are short-staffed and everyone&#8217;s just trying to keep heads above water on a day-to-day basis &#8211; so I always try to suggest how new tasks I&#8217;m suggesting fit into a very busy workload.</p>
<h1>Now for some real talk.</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why journalism?</strong><br />
I like disappointing my parents. Seriously, though, I wasn&#8217;t 100% sold on journalism until I worked at my college newspaper, The Daily Kent Stater, my freshman year. I was immediately hooked on the newsroom culture, getting information before everyone else, getting hate mail &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t imagine doing anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you subscribe to any print publications? If not, why?</strong><br />
We subscribe to a few magazines: <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, <em>ESPN</em>, <em>Food Network</em>&#8230;I&#8217;m still very attached to magazines as a print experience for some reason. We just recently moved, but in D.C. we did get the Sunday <em>Washington Post</em>. I rarely read the print edition, but my husband (who is a reporter) insisted on it. We might get a weekend paper here in New York, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What would happen if you were disconnected from the internet and your phone for 48 hours?</strong><br />
Everyone I know would think I was dead due to my social silence &#8211; and I might be because I rely on my phone&#8217;s mapping way too much. I could end up falling in the East River.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What was the first thing you read this morning?</strong><br />
Probably my notifications on my phone, usually in this order: Texts, tweet replies, Facebook comments, then emails.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is your all-time favorite sports team?</strong><br />
The Cincinnati Reds are my favorite team in any sport. When spring training rolls around, I&#8217;m going to be insufferable.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you could interview any historical figure, who would it be?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not an especially religious person, but probably Judas Iscariot. I&#8217;d like to know more about his side of the story &#8211; it&#8217;d be a compelling narrative, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s for lunch today?</strong><br />
A homemade <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/explore/mason-jar-salads/" target="_blank">stacked salad in a jar</a>. I&#8217;m sort of obsessed with the concept right now.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your go-to karaoke song? </strong><br />
Carly Simon&#8217;s &#8220;You&#8217;re So Vain&#8221; &#8211; everyone thinks it is about them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you listen to music these days? </strong><br />
Either on Rdio&#8217;s iPhone app or via the All Songs Considered podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You just moved to New York City from D.C. Which one wins your heart? </strong><br />
I&#8217;m very new to New York, so D.C. is still my favorite &#8211; but check back in a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <a href="http://www.raysplacekent.com/">Ray&#8217;s</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Loft-Kent/123798544359286">Loft</a>? Taylor or Franklin? </strong> <em>(Submitted by @twoTstwoFs)</em><br />
Those ones are easy for a Kent Stater of my generation: Ray&#8217;s and Taylor (of course). Ray&#8217;s is a Kent bar scene institution, Taylor Hall housed the journalism school when I was a student, now it is in Franklin Hall.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s your all-time favorite meme?</strong><br />
The <a title="Facebook reach down? Here’s a guide for what works, what doesn’t." href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/22/facebook-reach-journalists-guide/" target="_blank">Oprah Bees gif</a>. I still laugh hysterically every single time I see it. I will never stop loving it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What movie or book has had the greatest impact on you?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s probably no film I quote more in my day-to-day work life than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110771/">&#8220;The Paper&#8221;</a>. Sadly, nobody else gets it. I need to make Thunderdomers watch that movie sometime.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Name someone we should all follow on Twitter right now.</strong><br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/DFMThunderdome" target="_blank">@DFMThunderdome</a>, of course.</p>
