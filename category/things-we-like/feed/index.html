		<description><![CDATA[In the first of a series from Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR 14, Jason Hoppin explains the gift, and curse, of awareness in data journalism.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This is the first in a series of reports from three Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR14 through the <a title="And the #NICAR14 Digital First Represents winners are …" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/12/20/nicar14-digital-represents-winners-are/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents program</a>.</em></p>
<p>There were close to 1,000 journalists at the <a href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/" target="_blank">2014 NICAR convention</a>, a nearly 50 percent increase over the prior year. That there were so many should tell you a few things: the idea of bending technology to serve journalism (especially investigatory journalism) is reaching a critical mass; the technology itself is accelerating; and people are starting to see how incredibly valuable this toolbox is to finding and telling stories.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. You’ve heard of the wildly popular (it raised $500,000 via Kickstarter) <a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title" target="_blank">NPR t-shirt project</a>? People who were at the conference helped create it.</p>
<p>You know the crazy story of how the Florida SunSentinel used toll booth information to calculate how fast off-duty cops were driving? Data guys were behind it, and won <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Public-Service" target="_blank">a Pulitzer Prize</a> for public service.</p>
<p>How about the LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-0301-lafd-hiring-20140301,0,5887646.story#axzz2uviWfQLN" target="_blank">recently plowing through hiring practices</a> at the LA Fire Department, leading to allegations of nepotism and quick vows of reform? A data guy is on the byline.</p>
<p>But what I most want to tell people about is a phenomenon that occurs to people at NICAR with any level of experience. This happened to me several times:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bQxpk69At2g/Uo7YI1wiJ-I/AAAAAAAABzc/CC9xxeuXR6Y/s1600/72917-hold-it-hold-it-what-the-hell-gfHV.gif" /></p>
<p>Once, someone showed me how to yank a table out of a PDF using <a title="Tabula" href="http://tabula.nerdpower.org/" target="_blank">Tabula</a>, software he helped write. This is normally like pulling a sword from a stone. Now all you have to do is click, drag and push enter.</p>
<p>Another time, a speaker who was showing us how to manipulate spreadsheets with <a title="OpenRefine" href="http://openrefine.org/" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> vowed: “What I’m going to show you is pure magic. It’s a miracle of modern technology.” We were skeptical. The work he was talking about can take hours. And then he compressed everything into a single click of a button, and the room nearly broke out in a riot. (This same phenomenon happened to someone I know — he had spent four hours that week working on something that our own <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/mwebster" target="_blank">Mary Jo Webster</a> showed him how to do in five minutes).</p>
<p>One speaker told us to buy a $20 European USB radio tuner on Amazon, and within a few keystrokes you could have a map of every airplane flying overhead at that moment show up on your browser. You could also do this for every large boat off shore. And tune into pretty much any public safety radio frequency.</p>
<p>I learned how to script a web app and publish to the Internet without using a backend database <i>or even a web server </i>from the guy who put all of Nate Silver’s stuff up on the New York Times website.</p>
<p>I learned how to use <a href="http://ban.jo" target="_blank">Ban.jo</a>, <a href="http://foursquare.com" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://geofeedia.com" target="_blank">Geofeedia</a> to find sources at breaking news scenes, with the latter searching multiple social media platforms within a defined radius, at a certain time. Think about that.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of creating your own data, and how to utilize government inspection reports or fracking data or the Census. We heard a million great ideas. And we heard the limitations on those great ideas, because it all still comes down to reporting and verifying the truth.</p>
<p>Someone else taught us how to use cheap audio sensors to collect noise data and do stories, and how to hack digital cameras to take infrared pictures to track environmental changes. That speaker also talked about drones, and how <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/" target="_blank">Google has developed a smartphone</a> that could potentially use the power of the crowd to digitize and map the interior spaces of, well … everything, everywhere.</p>
<p>I won’t veer off here into evangelism about how valuable this stuff is in an increasingly abstracted world, chopped into bits and bytes, quantified, and stored on a server somewhere in the middle of Kansas. Though the thought did cross my mind.</p>
<p>But I was inspired. And I felt more cunning in a way, as if I learned to think differently about this job. It’s not like I didn’t know this was possible — well, hacking digital cameras was definitely new — but it feels more attainable, very much within reach.</p>
<p>That is the curse. I have been stripped of my excuses. There were people at the conference who barely spoke English and were still trying to sit around the fire in search in insight. What reasons do I have left? My chore now is to go commit some journalism. It is a nice burden to have, especially when you feel armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>That LA Times database nerd who’s nailing the LAFD to the wall? His name is Ben Welsh. He spoke at the conference, and someone was geeky enough to upload a cell phone video of his talk to YouTube, as if Ben were Bruce Springsteen covering a Lorde song.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t me. But you should watch it. Seriously.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This month's Thunderdome MVP was awarded to the guy who developed Mission Control, our in-house content management system.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Davis-Shaver_avatar_1378211885-300x300-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Davis Shaver, Thunderdome technology strategist" /></p><p>Recognition for this month&#8217;s Thunderdome MVP has been a long time coming. Let&#8217;s hear it for our technology strategist, <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/dshaver" target="_blank"><strong>Davis Shaver</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Davis spent a large part of 2013 developing Thunderdome&#8217;s in-house content management system (CMS), Mission Control.</p>
<div id="attachment_6678" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Davis-Shaver_avatar_1378211885-300x300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6678" alt="Davis Shaver, Thunderdome technology strategist" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Davis-Shaver_avatar_1378211885-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">He has it under control: Davis Shaver, Thunderdome technology strategist.</p></div>
<p><strong>About Mission Control</strong><br />
Mission Control makes it possible for us to efficiently produce content and distribute to Digital First Media channels and websites. Davis also devised a way for us to automate story budgets and communication, freeing up staff hours previously spent managing Google Doc budgets and crafting advisory emails. Anyone on staff a year ago can assure you, this is a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>About Davis&#8217; nomination:</strong><br />
Thunderdome&#8217;s MVP is voted on each month by a panel of anonymous judges. Anyone can be nominated by anyone on staff. In my nomination for Davis, I wanted to remind staff how greatly his work has impacted our operation. The completion of Mission Control was a milestone for Thunderdome&#8217;s operation. The nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Guys, Davis Shaver made Mission Control. HE MADE A CMS FOR THUNDERDOME TO PUSH CONTENT TO ALL OF DFM&#8217;S ONLINE CMSs. The all-caps are necessary. And it afforded us the opportunity to ditch manually-produced Google Doc budgets and manually-penned advisories. Truly all-star work by Davis on conceiving this system and seeing it through to completion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Davis&#8217; acceptance speech</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;The real MVP here is WordPress. In addition to relying on <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">the core software</a>, we&#8217;ve tapped related open source solutions like <a href="http://editflow.org/" target="_blank">EditFlow</a> and <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> to build a powerful editorial planning and production tool for the newsroom.</p>
<p>The best part about WordPress is that you&#8217;re not alone – we&#8217;ve benefitted from thoughts and practices shared by others at the intersection of WordPress and journalism through events hosted by the <a href="http://journalists.org/" target="_blank">Online News Association</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Big-Media-WordPress-Meetup/" target="_blank">WordPress Big Media Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be posting more information about our setup in the coming months, so stay tuned.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Also nominated:</strong></p>
<p>A great deal of appreciation for video journalist <strong><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/dfreid" target="_blank">David Freid</a></strong> this month, who was nominated twice. <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/sglen" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;From <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/guns/" target="_blank">Firearms in the Family</a> to our <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/celebrities/ci_25104719/watch-jimmy-fallons-high-school-slow-jam-jimmy" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon parody</a>, people are not taking enough time to consider all the work he puts in. He&#8217;s a great person to work with.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The second nomination came from <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/yleow" target="_blank">Yvonne Leow</a> who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;David shot the entire video and coached our very much non-professional actors how to read the script and execute their parts. We thought we had nothing to work with, but David suggested we embrace the low production quality of the shoot and run with it. So we did. But really, he did. And we&#8217;re so glad he did. He edited all of our footage together, used his editing prowess to include a plethora of unplanned jokes and made the video what it is. Delightfully lo-fi with impeccable comedic timing. If that weren&#8217;t enough, David shared the video with his friend who knows Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s wife who said &#8220;it was too cute.&#8221; We&#8217;re 100% confident that&#8217;s why Fallon tweeted our video this morning. SUCCESS.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch" target="_blank">Chris March</a><b> </b>(me), the third nominee, was nominated by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a> who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>(Chris) has been a total MVP lately in working with the news and feature staffs on big live events like the Golden Globes, Grammys and State of the Union, including lots of late nights alongside those staffs. He&#8217;ll also soon be taking on a lot of work with the Olympics with Gary&#8217;s team.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Editor’s note: This is the ninth in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>Twitter is a crucial tool in the modern reporter&#8217;s notebook. Why not order an upgrade?</p>
<p>My favorite new <i>free </i>(ding, ding, ding)<i> </i>Twitter tool is <a href="http://twxplorer.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">twXplorer</a>, which is a much smarter tool for searching Twitter. Here are some of the things twXplorer can do, and tips on how you can use it for your next story.</p>
<p><b>twXplorer can: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search any term</strong>. It&#8217;ll offer you the most common related terms, hashtags and links on anything you search for. This helps you dig deep.</li>
<li><strong>Search in 12 different languages</strong>. This is great for bilingual communities, like Colorado, and international reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Save &#8220;snapshots&#8221; to return to later. </strong>This could be great for keeping tabs on the various topics that you cover in your beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For example:<br />
</b><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Hypothetical scenerio: I am the new beat reporter to cover Colorado State University. I search &#8220;CSU&#8221; and </span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">twXplorer returns several recent Tweets with the term CSU, including this one:</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>2 freshmen reported dead in CSU dorms in past 2 weeks <a href="http://t.co/J03Mx10CvZ">http://t.co/J03Mx10CvZ</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/KDVR">@kdvr</a></p>
<p>— Luke Runyon (@LukeRunyon) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeRunyon/statuses/395592259229323264">October 30, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It returns tweets for you just like this, allowing you to reply, retweet favorite or follow from the twXplorer site.</p>
<p>It also provides a list of common related terms and common related hashtags.</p>
<p>On the list of common related terms of my &#8220;CSU&#8221; search was <i style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#8220;kappas khaotikkorruption.&#8221; </i><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This curious term has been used 24 times recently in connection with CSU, and it&#8217;s also hashtagged 24 times, making it the second most popular hashtag related to CSU.</span></p>
<p>I clicked on it to bring up the tweets and see what it was about. It&#8217;s about a party, it turns out. Probably not a story. But worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CSU&amp;src=hash">#CSU</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FVSU&amp;src=hash">#FVSU</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASU&amp;src=hash">#ASU</a> THE OFFICIAL FOUNTAIN CITY CLASSIC AFTERPARTY W/ THE KAPPAS <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KHAOTIKKORRUPTION&amp;src=hash">#KHAOTIKKORRUPTION</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DJMrPolo">@DjMRPOLO</a> SPIN&#8217;N! $5 PRESALE BANDS, HMU! X20</p>
<p>— Keyy DOPPPEEEEE (@Its_Keyara) <a href="https://twitter.com/Its_Keyara/statuses/395410656720982016">October 30, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The search results screen also provides several links from Twitter that mention CSU, including a <a href="http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_24414253/kapri-bibbs-carrying-load-colorado-state" target="_blank">Reporter-Herald article</a> that has been tweeted multiple times.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Kapri Bibbs carrying the load for Colorado State &#8211; Loveland Reporter-Herald <a href="http://t.co/m80pETH3UE">http://t.co/m80pETH3UE</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/reporterherald">@reporterherald</a></p>
<p>— Jolyon Hughes (@jitmon) <a href="https://twitter.com/jitmon/statuses/395567847528603648">October 30, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty cool stuff, right? By comparison, here is what happens <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=csu&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">when you search &#8220;CSU&#8221;</a> with Twitter&#8217;s default search bar:</p>
<p><strong>All content, no context</strong>. You get a long stream of posts about CSU. Many are still useful, but they are out of context and don&#8217;t reflect trends. Example:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Today, I&#8217;m teaching a newswriting class at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CSU&amp;src=hash">#CSU</a>! I love talking to budding journos.</p>
<p>— Aimee Heckel (@aimeemay) <a href="https://twitter.com/aimeemay/statuses/395579486487318528">October 30, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A lot of what you aren&#8217;t looking for.</strong> twXplorer&#8217;s trend filter sifts through the spam and provides more meaning to your search. It&#8217;s precise and intuitive while Twitter&#8217;s default search is more like firing a shotgun in the dark with the hope you hit something. Example:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Make your day brighter one glass at a time with <a href="https://twitter.com/CrystalLight">@CrystalLight</a>, and earn money using <a href="https://twitter.com/IbottaApp">@IbottaApp</a>! <a href="http://t.co/fIrUPad0FR">pic.twitter.com/fIrUPad0FR</a></p>
<p>— Nhat Quang Nguyen (@Nhat_Nguyen_CSU) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nhat_Nguyen_CSU/statuses/400405441467121665">November 12, 2013</a></p></blockquote>

These tech trends can make a difference now. (Thinkstock)" /></p><p><em><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4832" alt="amy_webb" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a>Editor’s note: This is the seventh in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/amy-webb">Amy Webb</a>’s &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/10-tech-trends/#.UncxShXn-mQ">10 Tech Trends for Journalists</a>&#8220; was one of the most fascinating (and entertaining) of the ONA 13 conference (<a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/ona2013" target="_blank">see the slides</a> and <a href="http://www.livestream.com/ona13/video?clipId=pla_18b4730d-fccc-45db-bebd-29c85a86a226" target="_blank">video</a>).</p>
<p>From a demo of MindMeld anticipatory computing to a live drone flight it was an exciting glimpse at the future by the digital futurist. But I left the session thinking, how could this possibly relate to my newsroom right now? We’re barely keeping up with today’s technology, and now we’re supposed to be using Google Glass, talking to virtual personal assistants and learning how to fly drones? I decided to pick four topics, explore them a little more and think of some ways our resources could be applied toward these future trends.</p>
<h1><b>Trend 1: Smart virtual personal assistants (SVPAs)<br />
</b></h1>
<p>The second trend Webb talked about was &#8220;smart virtual personal assistants&#8221; like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/donna-manage-your-day/id617548142">Donna</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osito/id617172452?mt=8">Osito</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tempo-smart-calendar-free/id593819390">Tempo</a> and <a href="https://www.cueup.com/">Cue</a>. Basically, these apps scrape the calendars, contacts lists, social media and email on your phone and combine that data with real-time weather and traffic information to help organize your day. Webb said SVPAs have become a $400 million market(!) in the past 12 months.</p>
<div id="attachment_4826" style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4826  " alt="Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times' info on Election Day?" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg" width="307" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times&#8217; info on Election Day?</p></div>
<p>How can news organizations get into the action? This got me thinking. How does news consumption fit into a person’s daily habits? Here is a very rough estimation of a local person&#8217;s routine in El Paso, Tex.</p>
<p><em><strong>Morning</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skim headlines to see if anything big happened overnight and to see what will happen today.</li>
<li>Check the weather so I know how to dress for the day.</li>
<li>Listen to the radio to learn about any traffic accidents or closures that I should avoid on my commute to work.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>At work</strong>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Possibly do some research on <a href="http://elpasotime.com" target="_blank">elpasotimes.com</a> if my job involves local people and businesses.</li>
<li>If I travel for work, I need continued updates on traffic and weather.</li>
<li>If breaking news happens during the day, I want to be alerted to it and will follow updates from my phone.</li>
<li>May make plans for evening and weekend activities. Look up information on events, restaurants and venues.</li>
<li>Will check for more traffic and weather updates before leaving the office.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Evening</strong>:</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Scan the headlines from the day. May spend some time reading longer features or watching short videos online before bed.</li>
<li>May take a look at my schedule for tomorrow or later in the week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if we got our news from SVPAs?</strong><br />
It seems like SVPAs (at least the ones I looked at) don&#8217;t account for news at this point, which seems like an unfortunate gap (or a great opportunity). What would an SVPA look like if it incorporated content from your local news organization? Take a short trip with me into the future:</p>
<p>In addition to my scheduled events, contacts and social media, the SVPA could include helpful nuggets of &#8220;news I can use.&#8221; In the morning, I would get the latest traffic and weather information and a short news briefing (in text or audio form, depending on my preference).</p>
<p>In the event of breaking news, I&#8217;d get an alert and short updates on how this developing story may affect me. How do I avoid the traffic mess caused by an accident or crime scene? When do I pick up my child in a lockdown situation? Such an app could also link me directly to the El Paso TImes&#8217; social media channels.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Our news and event calendars would also be a great asset for an SVPA. If I&#8217;m reading about an event on elpasotimes.com or on our mobile app, I could save it to my calendar so all the info about the event would automatically populate in the SVPA. Or I could program it to include a series of events, like all UTEP football home games, or all El Paso Symphony Orchestra concerts. Besides the basic &#8220;if you go&#8221; information, the event information could include links to related articles, such as game UTEP game previews, or a review of a play I’m going to.</span></p>
<p>The personalization of these apps make them ideal tools to send me articles I really want to read. Is there a local news topic I’m continually interested in? Is there news about my neighborhood? The app could personally deliver these articles right to my phone as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>Obviously, a lot of work would need to go into restructuring the data of our content and calendars to communicate with such an app. But something like this would definitely make local news a more integrated part of a person&#8217;s day, giving them personalized information as they need it, when they want it.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 2: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>This trend surprised me at first, but after a few slides the connection to journalists seemed obvious to me.</p>
<p>There is typically a low barrier to entry for MOOCs and many are offered for free and with no commitment to continue. Webb called this trend &#8220;snackable&#8221; learning. She said Millennials are particularly fond of MOOCs and referred to them as &#8220;addictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some examples of MOOCs are <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (math and science courses offered free online, with partnerships from some organizations, <a href="http://curious.com">Curious.com</a> (how-to videos on a variety of subjects, some offered for free) and <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> (courses in web development, business fundamentals, product management, etc.). Webb seemed to think there was a good opportunity for partnership with MOOCs like these.</p>
<p>One of Webb’s key points was that a MOOC leverages something you are doing anyway, but packages<strong> </strong>it in a different way. I think she’s right — it’s time for us to get creative about packaging the content we are producing. I also think it would be great to leverage our newsroom&#8217;s talents and interests in a way other than having them write a blog or column.</p>
<p>These are the five types of MOOCs for newsrooms that Webb suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking news analysis cheat sheet</li>
<li>Authentic how-to video</li>
<li>1-minute explainer video</li>
<li>Staff round up</li>
<li>Quiz</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few ideas I had for each of those that I think readers might be interested in. These are localized to El Paso, but could easily be adapted to any locale:</p>
<p><strong>Breaking news analysis cheat sheets</strong> (see The Washington Post’s great <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/29/9-questions-about-syria-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask/">9 things about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining the Mexican drug war</li>
<li>A quick history of El Paso</li>
<li>School cheating investigations in El Paso County</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How-to videos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to make pumpkin tortilla soup</li>
<li>How to plant a vegetable garden in the desert</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also produce how-to videos that help readers contribute their own content</p>
<ul>
<li>How to write an obituary</li>
<li>How to write a classified ad that will get noticed</li>
<li>How to record a professional looking video with your smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1-minute explainer video</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The building of El Paso’s new baseball stadium</li>
<li>How did the Asarco smokestacks get demolished?</li>
<li>Why is global climate change happening?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Staff roundup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Book of the month by a local author from our book page editor</li>
<li>5 can’t miss things to do in El Paso this weekend from our entertainment editor</li>
<li>5 best sports tweets this week</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quiz</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What happened in El Paso this week? 10-question quiz</li>
<li>How well do you know El Paso? 100-question quiz with prizes</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Beyond those, it would be interesting to explore a long-form course on a subject of interest to our readers that would keep them coming back, week after week, familiarizing them with our newsroom. For example, we could do a 10-part El Paso history series with our staff librarian. </span></p>
<h1><strong>Trend 3: Comments<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Webb also had some interesting things to say about the future of reader comments on news sites. She says, as they exist today, comments are not adding value to our product and are a distraction, and gave some horrifying examples to prove her point.</p>
<p>To remedy this, she suggested that news organizations create comment systems that are similar to a cocktail party — only include comments from people that I know or &#8220;find fascinating,&#8221; with the ability to invite others into the conversation.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/LittleGuyInATie" target="_blank">Lucas</a> and I had a discussion about this after the talk. He said, &#8220;Wouldn’t it get boring after awhile, to hear the same old voices in the comment forum?&#8221; I disagreed, thinking commenting on our site could benefit from some curation. Friends and &#8220;top commenters&#8221; could move to the top, with all others after that. Our conversation was a reminder that different people want different things from comments, and it&#8217;s hard to make one system that fits them all.</p>
<p>I checked out a few of the sites that Webb mentioned to see what the cutting edge of commenting technology looks like. <a href="http://gawker.com">Gawker</a> makes you create a <a href="http://kinja.com/" target="_blank">Kinja</a> account (and therefore, a blog) in order for you to comment. They also <a href="http://gawker.com/crime-in-the-hamptons-is-exactly-like-youd-expect-1457278259">inform you when the author of the article is participating</a> (a great idea, I thought). <a href="http://qz.com/">Quartz</a> allows you to annotate in the margins of an article. I was impressed at the look of it, though I wonder if it is too much work for the average reader to click on each paragraph rather than just see all the comments at one glance. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> has three comment views – All, Reader Picks and NYT picks. Though not in Webb&#8217;s presentation, I also took a look at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post</a>, where a &#8220;Community Pundits&#8221; comment appears at the top of the comments section. After that you can choose between Highlighted, Most Recent, Oldest and Most Faved comment views.</p>
<p>My dream comment looks like this (click photo to enlarge):<br />
<a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4828" alt="comment_system" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg" width="1134" height="642" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You must sign in, preferably with a social media account tied to your real name. No anonymous commenting.</li>
<li>Readers can comment anywhere in the article, including at the end if they want to write something long.</li>
<li>Readers would have the option to view comments, or not, through options on a floating toolbar on the side of the page. (I’m envisioning something like VH1’s old <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156226/" target="_blank">Pop Up Videos</a> as what the comments might look like.)</li>
<li>Comments from my friends on social media, most popular commenters and the author of the post are color-coded and you could choose to view only those comments if you wish.</li>
<li>A sophisticated algorithm sorts all this out and a real person does not make a full-time job out of filtering comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know, it’s a lot to ask. I think comment forums are one of the trickiest aspects of our site to manage. How do we encourage comments that are fun and insightful that will enhance readers&#8217; engagement with our content? On the other hand, how do we make it so that comments are not a distraction from the content itself? And how do we keep all those trolls away? It&#8217;s a delicate balance and I think more experimentation is a great trend.</p>
<p>Zack Harold recently wrote about <a title="Want to improve your online comments? Don’t feed the trolls" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/11/05/improve-online-comments-feed-trolls/" target="_blank">how to deal with online trolls</a> from a different ONA13 session.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 4: Data<br />
</strong></h1>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Webb says 2014 is the year data goes completely mainstream. She said everyone in the newsroom needs to get experience with data, now.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately she didn’t get to spend too much time on this. But she is right.</p>
<p>Data was a <em>HUGE</em> topic at ONA13. Here are some of the sessions that focused on data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/closing-the-digital-and-data-divide/#.UnfPNETPdJ8">Closing the Digital and Data Divide: Data Journalism in Developing Countries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">Storytelling with Data</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">I Need Data for My Story. Help.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/tower-of-babel-problem/">Data Journalism: The Tower of Babel Problem</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/your-datas-showing/#.UnfPr0TPdJ8">&#8220;Ha, Your Data&#8217;s Showing&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Big Data, Little Newsroom</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Building Your First Data Driven Map with Tile Mill</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/friday-lunch-keynote/#.UnfP30TPdJ8">ONA13 keynote</a> was delivered by Nate Silver of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">fivethirtyeight.com</a>.</p>
<p>So, what needs to happen for newsrooms to fully embrace data journalism?</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two different classes of people in a newsroom and both of them need help:</p>
<p>First, we need to bring people who don’t usually deal with data visualization into the fold and get them to think in a &#8220;data&#8221; mindset. We need to fundamentally rewire the way journalists think about their stories. Data is an integral way of telling a story, especially in a digital format. Many journalists still aren&#8217;t getting it.</p>
<p>But I would argue that the most skilled of the data journalists in smaller newsrooms face a whole slew of problems, too. How many of us are trained statisticians? How do we know how to &#8220;clean&#8221; data and interpret it correctly? How many of us are experienced at coding? One of the biggest obstacles we face is that we lack the manpower to take on big projects. <a href="https://github.com/DFMdata?tab=members" target="_blank">DFM’s data team</a> is a great idea in this respect. They provide professional help for the more ambitious projects we want to take on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting journey digging into just a few technology trends that Webb identified in her crystal ball (I&#8217;m still pondering Google Glass and drones). Webb is someone I&#8217;m definitely going to keep an eye on in the next few years (on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/WebbMedia">@WebbMedia</a>). Who can say which of her trends will end up being &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; but we&#8217;re sure to hear more about everything she talked about.</p>
<p>The unknown can be scary but I&#8217;m also excited about the possibilities for the future of journalism.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I came back to the Morning Sun from ONA13 stirring with ideas for how to better engage our readers and to improve our storytelling. Here are the top five.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/articlemachine-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Some questions to tackle in breaking the article machine. (Credit: Karen Workman, via Twitter @KarenWorkman)" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the sixth in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I came back to the <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/" target="_blank">Morning Sun</a> from <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/" target="_blank">ONA13</a> stirring with ideas for how to better engage our readers and to improve our storytelling. Here are the top five:</p>
<p><strong>1. Launch a community photo club. </strong><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/what-is-photojournalism-worth/#.UnqV8JRga0Q" target="_blank">One of my favorite sessions</a> focused on National Geographic&#8217;s <a href="http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/" target="_blank">Your Shot photo community.</a> The concept is to engage with photo talent from your audience and create content around specific topics or assignments. This inspired us at the Morning Sun to start a mid-Michigan photo community. We will use a Facebook group and blog to share images and communicate weekly assignments, tips and techniques. We will use these submitted pictures to curate photo galleries in our <a href="http://media.morningsun.com/" target="_blank">Media Center</a>. We will regularly feature our favorite submissions as the Morning Sun Facebook timeline image. The goal is to capture more images with beauty and emotion from our communities, beyond the typical reader-generated snapshots. We may even use some of that content in print, too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Collaborate with students on a sensor journalism project.</strong> One of the most exciting sessions I attended <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/sensor-journalism/#.UnqWppRga0Q" target="_blank">centered on sensor journalism</a>. This is an area of journalism that uses technology to collect data, often with participation from the public. <a href="https://twitter.com/jkeefe" target="_blank">John Keefe</a> from WNYC explained Radio Lab&#8217;s <a href="http://project.wnyc.org/cicadas/" target="_blank">cicada project</a>, which is an amazing example of sensor journalism. My long-term goal in sensor journalism is to collaborate with a group of elementary or middle school kids, and a local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" target="_blank">makerspace or hackerspace</a> (groups that find ways to create gadgets) on a sensor project. The starting point is to introduce the concept to a group of local students to come up with an interesting sensor project to tackle. The most popular lunch room table or playground equipment based on bodies and time spent are some ideas I had, but I want to discover what the students are interested in. Then, we could work with a makerspace to create the technology to measure, and create data-driven content from the collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>3. Apply data to our &#8220;Sound Off!&#8221; feature. </strong>The session &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnrXppRga0Q" target="_blank">Big data, little newsroom</a>,&#8221; focused on methods and resources to get small newsrooms comfortable with the idea of data journalism. <a href="https://twitter.com/emmacarew" target="_blank">Emma Carew Grovum</a> shared helpful resources addressing issues for many journalists such as fear of math (I have this phobia) like this <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/slanews/conferences/sla2005/programs/mathcrib.htm" target="_blank">crib sheet</a> on basic data math formulas and this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BizJournalism" target="_blank">slideshow</a> (with homework!) for business journalism tips. I am going to start with something simple and clean (a tip I learned in the session). The Morning Sun has a daily feature called <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/opinion/20131004/sound-off-friday-saturday-oct-4-5" target="_blank">Sound Off</a>! where readers leave us a voicemail message anonymously expressing their opinion on whatever issue they want to &#8220;sound off&#8221; on. What I would like to do is track Sound Off each week and graph the number of calls on each topic, bringing to light what currently has our audience the most fired up and engaged.</p>
<p><strong>4. Create interactive timelines with Timeline JS.</strong> I discovered <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/timeline-js/#.UnrcVpRga0Q" target="_blank">Timeline JS</a> at ONA13 and this tool makes it ridiculously easy to create beautiful, interactive timelines. I am working on my first timeline this week, focused on the personal history of a family who is being disenrolled from the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe. Their story is part of a <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/general-news/20131104/tribal-judge-strips-four-and-40-descendants-of-membership" target="_blank">larger news issue</a> in which more than 10% of the tribe will be kicked out based on technical issues with record keeping in the 1800s. The timeline will help illustrate the somewhat confusing facts dealing with member payouts from casino profits, three different member rolls and families that can trace lineage back to the original members of the tribe, like Chief Pontiac. <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">Using Timeline JS</a> is as easy as copy-and-pasting info and links into an already-created spreadsheet. Try it out for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>5. Push newsroom to think &#8220;outside the article.&#8221;</strong> The session &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/broke-the-article-machine/#.Unrc7pRga0Q" target="_blank">Oops, we broke the article machine: Imagining what comes next,</a>&#8221; broke attendees into groups, gave them a news situation, and gave them one rule: Create a coverage plan without a traditional written article. The room was packed, the energy was amazing and the variety of concept ideas ranged from surveys, interactive games, clickable maps and databases. I plan to implement this concept with my co-workers, to challenge our concept of what the best method for telling any giving story is. With all the tools we have at our disposal in the digital age, why should we resort to presenting a story the same way newspapers did in the 1800s? This kind of brainstorming and forward-thinking is crucial to digital first newsrooms.<strong> </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/videolicious-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="videolicious" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the third in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program. </em></p>
<p>Professor Jeremy Caplan’s presentation at ONA13, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qxs7QHU16YQT2nOsh4Cm3q6NOZDn4fZelAI2I28FV0E/edit" target="_blank">21 Ways to Awesome-ize Your Mobile Toolkit</a>, had me ooh-ing and aah-ing over new apps to try. In his presentation, Caplan advised us to “Pick. Stick. Dig.” with apps, meaning don’t just download a bunch of apps for the sake of having them, but choose a few you will use and dig into the features. In keeping with that, here are my experiences with seven of the apps Caplan talked about.</p>
<h1><strong>1: <a href="http://campl.us/">Camera+</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: A photo app with many useful features.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $1.99 in App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: The app allows you a plethora of options to adjust photos after they are taken. Choose from a variety of “scene” adjustments – Clarity, Auto, Flash, Backlit, Darken, Cloudy, Shade, etc. You can tilt or flip the photo and choose from a variety of crop options. You can also add filters and a variety of borders.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a photo I adjusted with Camera+:</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Baseball stadium going up: <a href="http://t.co/KMnufniZsV">pic.twitter.com/KMnufniZsV</a></p>
<p>— Annette Arrigucci (@elpasoanne) <a href="https://twitter.com/elpasoanne/statuses/394139086157406208">October 26, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>After:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Here is stadium construction photo edited with Camera+ <a href="http://t.co/4vTZoMYJbO">pic.twitter.com/4vTZoMYJbO</a></p>
<p>— Annette Arrigucci (@elpasoanne) <a href="https://twitter.com/elpasoanne/statuses/394142111982825473">October 26, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Camera+ also allows you to square crop or use Stabilizer, Timer and Burst modes if you are shooting a photo within the app.</p>
<p>You can quickly view the photos you took or modified within the app in your Lightbox. Metadata has a cool map showing where you took the photo and other technical specs about it. You have the option to save this to your camera roll, email, share to social media or delete it.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>The verdict</strong>: This seems like a must-have tool for photographers who are taking many photos and need to edit them quickly. For shooting inside the app, Timer and Burst mode work great. However, it may be a little too much for reporters. The iPhone&#8217;s standard photos app offers quick adjustments that are similar to what is included here.</span></p>
<h1>2. <a href="http://joby.com/gorillacam" target="_blank">GorillaCam</a></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: An app for shooting time-lapse and stop-motion videos.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free in App Store; Pro version available for $1.99</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: On GorillaCam you can choose between stop motion, time-lapse and camera modes.</p>
<p>I tried the stop motion feature with 10 shots. It worked for editing the shots together into a video, but the free version did not give me the option to control the video length, so it was very difficult to see each shot. With the free version, it seems like you would need to take a lot of shots (maybe 50 to 100) to make the video comprehensible. If you are interested in this feature it’s worth upgrading to the paid version.</p>
<p>The time-lapse feature is more promising because you can control the length of timelapse and the length of the video. I chose a capture time of 10 minutes and a playback time of 10 seconds. The app took 240 frames to make the 10-second video. The video was automatically added to my camera roll. The only drawback I found is that you definitely need a stable place to set up the iPhone. The Gorilla Cam app <a href="http://joby.com/gorillapod" target="_blank">advertises a GorillaPod stand</a> and I can see why. Lacking that, I set up books and boxes to prop the iPhone up to make a video of my fish tank.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/q5Qn5jaxLBI" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Camera mode has settings for a timer, burst mode and anti-shake.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Time-lapse feature is fantastic, though you may need some equipment to stabilize the camera. Upgrade to pro for stop motion.</p>
<h1><strong>3: <a href="http://photosynth.net/">PhotoSynth</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Easy way to shoot wraparound panoramas and publish them.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free on App Store</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>My experience</strong>: It took me a few tries to get used to shooting the panoramic photo; there are no tips for shooting on the help document. You have to be very steady and move the camera very slowly. I took three shots going top to bottom in one spot before moving the camera to the left. One helpful aspect is you can see how it is going to look as you are shooting it.</span></p>
<p>The final product looks amazing. You can spin around in 360 degrees, move up, move down, zoom in, zoom out. Be aware that a few minor imperfections show up, especially if you are shooting anything with sharp lines.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://photosynth.net/embed.aspx?cid=8964b7aa-4ea7-4b81-b36e-6b04dc06c9e5&amp;delayLoad=true&amp;slideShowPlaying=false" height="360" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Sharing the final product requires you to sign in with a Microsoft account (or sign up for one). You also must put the panorama on your account on the <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=8964b7aa-4ea7-4b81-b36e-6b04dc06c9e5" target="_blank">PhotoSynth website</a> to be able to view it through the PhotoSynth viewer on a desktop. You do have the option to make it unlisted. You can embed the panorama in an article or on a blog, as I did here.</p>
<p>Deleting a synth is tricky. You can delete it before PhotoSynth makes a panorama out of it. After that you must delete it using your account on the Photosynth website.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: The final product will “wow” readers. Sign-in requirement is mildly annoying and the help documentation could use some additional tips on shooting.</p>
<h1><strong>4: <a href="http://cinemagr.am/">Cinemagram</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Create animated-gif style short videos easily.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free on App Store</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>My experience</strong>: You must sign in to Twitter, Facebook or register for an account to use Cinemagram. Cinemagram is a network where others can view your Cines. There is a very short, helpful tutorial on how to use Cinemagram.</span></p>
<p>To record you hold down the record button for as long or short as you like and Cinemagram stitches them together into a video that is up to four seconds long. You also have the option to import video or photos from your camera roll.</p>
<p>If you enable the microphone, sound is automatically recorded with each video. Before you post the Cine, you have the option to turn off the sound. (This is a good idea because the sound goes on auto-play as soon as you open it and can get very annoying.) You can also apply filters to your Cines, similar to Instagram.</p>
<p>Here are two Cines I made:</p>
<p><iframe id="cinemagram" style="postion: absolute; left: 0px; width: 100%; top: 0px; height: 100%;" src="http://cinemagr.am/embed/156853229" height="480" width="360" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe id="cinemagram" style="postion: absolute; left: 0px; width: 100%; top: 0px; height: 100%;" src="http://cinemagr.am/embed/156855973" height="480" width="360" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>If you signed in with Twitter, watch out because automatic sharing to Twitter is enabled by default so when you post a new video it will automatically tweet it to your followers.</p>
<p>It is not very intuitive to find the delete button on a Cine. You need to go to your profile and click the … button on the Cine you want to delete. Also, the FAQ says you can make a Cine private; however, I could not find the option for it.</p>
<p>The videos were viewable on Firefox and Chrome, but I could not see them on IE 10. There is an option to embed them in articles and blog posts.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Very easy and fun to create Cines, though it could take some time to do it well enough to stand out in a crowd. The privacy concerns are also an issue – make sure you save only finished products. Options for short videos in hard news stories may be limited, but it might be a fun promo for a special feature. And we get more screen time and similar functionality with <a href="http://www.tout.com/" target="_blank">Tout</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://vine.co/" target="_blank">Vine</a>.</p>
<h1><strong>5: <a href="http://madewithover.com/">Over</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Layer text over a photo.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $1.99 on App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: You can take a photo with the app or select one from your album, then add text or artwork (must login or signup to use artwork). It’s extremely easy to add text with a variety of font or colors and drag the text anywhere on the photo you would like. Edit the size, opacity, position, alignment, character spacing or line height of the text. You can also crop the photo to a square and adjust the tint on the photo. There are about 30 creative-looking fonts to choose from. You must “unlock” others.</p>
<p>Here are a couple I made:</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ona.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4761" alt="ona" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ona-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ready_to_blog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4762" alt="ready_to_blog" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ready_to_blog-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Once you’re done you can save the photo to your camera roll or share on Facebook, Twitter, Path, Instagram, Message or Email. There are many great examples on Instagram.</p>
<p>One minor confusion was the “Reset” option. Reset starts you over from scratch with a new photo.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Very easy to use with elegant results. Love the design of this app.</p>
<h1><strong>6: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/soundcloud/id336353151">SoundCloud</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Record and edit audio.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free on App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: You must sign in with Google+, Facebook or create a SoundCloud account. Oddly, there is no “Record” button on the bottom bar. The Record button appears the first time you hit the “You” button. It also shows on the “Activity” button.</p>
<p>Tap the big red “record” button to start recording. You can stop and resume recording as much as you want. To edit, tap the scissors button to the right of the record button. Unfortunately you can only cut from beginning or end. If you want to edit out a part in the middle of the recording, you will need use a more advanced audio editor on your computer or re-record the audio from the Soundcloud app. Although, one nice feature is that you can begin recording again from the end point you trimmed. You can save or delete the audio file after editing.</p>
<p>If you save you can make the recording public or private. It automatically appears in your SoundCloud account. You can share it to Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or email.</p>
<p>You can access your recording on SoundCloud.com. Here you can download the audio file or share your recording via a link or embed. Free accounts are limited to two hours of audio, but you can delete older files to make space.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117541449" height="166" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Good quality audio for up-close recording, such as a podcast. You would have to test this app in different environments. Not sure if it works well in a large public place, i.e. to record a speech. The in-app editing tool is a little clunky, but you can download the file and use another tool to edit if necessary. Ability to embed or link the audio in a story is fantastic and opens up many possibilities for interactive articles.</p>
<h1><strong>7: <a href="https://videolicious.com/">Videolicious</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Quickly create a video with voiceover and/or music.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free in App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: Videolicious offers a short tutorial on how to use the app, which is helpful since it’s a little complex. You begin by choosing video clips from your camera roll, which show as thumbnails on the right side of the screen. Then you can begin recording your own voiceover with the clips as B-roll. This may look a little weird as it shows you recording yourself, but you can strip the video of yourself in the final product.</p>
<p>You can choose when you want the clip to transition to the next by clicking on a thumbnail. Unfortunately, you must record the entire narration all at once. You cannot stop and start the recording whenever you want. When you stop recording you can review the video and either delete or save it.</p>
<p>You can also choose music from the app to go with your narration. There are several styles of music to choose from (and even more if you upgrade to a pro account). The music didn’t sound bad with my narration, but in the end I decided to skip it.</p>
<p>After that, the app asks what quality you want for the video (SD or HD). You can share to email, Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. The video will process and then it will upload. Upload time is a bit long and it’s recommended that you stay in the app the entire time. The video is also saved to your camera roll.</p>
<p>I emailed the video to myself and was able to play the video within the email or on the Videolicious site. However, it would not allow me to embed it on an outside site. I had to share it to my YouTube account to get the option to embed.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ep0eQps0INk" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: This is an easy way to make short, professional-looking videos with narration from your phone. The main downside is that it is annoying to have to record the narration all at once and have to start over if you make a mistake. I would choose this over iMovie for short projects. For longer ones, I would go with iMovie because it has more features.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/AP02071502903-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="In this 2002 file photo, U.S. jazzman Wynton Marsalis performs during his concert with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra at the Stravinski hall stage of the Montreux Jazz Festival, in Montreux, Switzerland.  (AP Photo/Keystone,  Fabrice Coffrini)" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the second in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program. </em></p>
<p>Jazz trumpet master Wynton Marsalis once described jazz as “the art of managing change without losing the focus on substance.” Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Change is built into the DNA of jazz, but it&#8217;s also a huge part journalism. And <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraNorton">Laura Amico</a> of Glass Eye Media believes reporters have much to learn from America&#8217;s art form.</p>
<p>That was the premise of <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/jazz-and-journalism/" target="_blank">Amico&#8217;s talk</a> on the first day of the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/" target="_blank">Online News Association&#8217;s 2013 conference</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jazz offers us more than metaphor. It offers us a framework and vocabulary&#8221; for how journalism can change, <a title="A Storify of tweets from Amico's jazz and journalism talk" href="http://storify.com/slilwall/jazz-and-journalism-improvising-innovation?utm_campaign=website&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email">Amico said.</a></p>
<p>She first came upon the concept during a concert Marsalis gave at Harvard, shortly after the  Boston Marathon bombings. The pain of the attack was still in the air, but Marsalis talked about how music captures both our sorrow and our joy.</p>
<p>Amico realized that the same was true of journalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reporting we do in these moments are our highest art form,&#8221; she said, because it shows a way forward.</p>
<p>And she believes the analogy can go further.</p>
<p>Jazz relies heavily on improvisation. But musicians aren&#8217;t just onstage, making things up. Rather, each solo is based on a framework of notes, scales and rhythm. Musicians must know these fundamentals inside and out before ever stepping up to the mic.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the rest of the band. Even the best solo would fall flat if there wasn&#8217;t a good rhythm section holding down the beat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Improvisation is not accidental, it&#8217;s not serendipitous and it&#8217;s not experimentation,&#8221; Amico said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each band member has different tasks, recognizes and understands that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newsrooms also are frequently called upon to improvise, and Amico said we should look to jazz as a model for how to handle this challenge.</p>
<p>The key to improvisation is saying &#8220;yes.&#8221; Newsrooms need to embrace uncertainty and try something new. We already have a whole tool bag of skills at our side, it&#8217;s only a matter of using these tools in different ways.</p>
<p>Amico said it&#8217;s also important for journalism, like jazz, to allow our audience to dance. An audience&#8217;s reaction often changes the way musicians play. She used the story of Duke Ellington&#8217;s <a href="http://youtu.be/XNBpMRPfw0A">1956 performance at the Newport Jazz Festival</a> as an example:</p>
<p>Amico said the same thing should happen in our newsrooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality of journalism isn&#8217;t about what reporters do, but their interaction with the public,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s been true as long as reporters have conducted interviews. But unlike the days of old when readers had to wait to see stories in print, our audience now can interact with journalists throughout the reporting process now. In a way, the audience becomes part of the story from the very beginning, through social media interaction, emails, etc.</p>
<p>Amico encouraged reporters to embrace that audience participation. If readers take part in the process, they&#8217;ll be more invested in the product. She said it&#8217;s fine for newspapers to ask something of their readers, other than just picking up the paper or looking at a website. And readers usually don&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p>There are other lessons we reporters can learn from jazz music, too, as one of my Twitter followers reminded me.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ZackHarold">@ZackHarold</a> Jazz lessons for journos?

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of it as a competitor to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>, stop now – I made the same mistake. DocumentCloud differs in a few fundamental ways, in large part because it caters specifically to journalists, thanks to stewardship by <a href="http://www.ire.org/">Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors</a> and early funding by the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a>. Intended from <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/encyclo/documentcloud/">inception</a> to serve journalists, DocumentCloud has a number of &#8220;killer&#8221; features for reporters and editors dealing with document collections.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we put together a list of five ways DocumentCloud can be used to support journalism in a local newsroom. Find those below.</p>
<p>We also recommend checking out <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/686468-using-documentcloud.html">this guide to using DocumentCloud</a> – it&#8217;s a great resource that had Jaimi made for <a href="http://live.outsidethunderdome.com/Event/Live_Chat_Ted_Han_and_Jaimi_Dowell">our chat</a>! And if you have other tips to share, leave them in the comments.</p>
<h3>Five Ways DocumentCloud Can Support Journalism</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintain private notes on a document. </strong>In a newsroom years ago, you might be able to tell how info-dense a document was by the number of Post-It Notes attached. DocumentCloud lets you do the same thing, without the risk of paper cuts. Private notes can be attached to any section of a document, where they also get organized on a dedicated &#8216;Notes&#8217; tab.</li>
<li><strong><span><span style="line-height: 14px">Collaborate on annotations and publish them with the document.</span></span></strong><span><span style="line-height: 14px"> Not all notes are meant to be private. One of the neatest uses of DocumentCloud I&#8217;ve seen is the &#8216;Show Sources&#8217; feature ProPublica built to integrate annotations into story presentation – <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/why-cant-linda-carswell-get-her-husbands-heart-back">great example here</a>. Think of it as showing your work.</span></span></li>
<li><strong>Extract structured data using OpenCalais. </strong>DocumentCloud processes documents with <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">OpenCalais</a>, a Thomson Reuters service that discovers &#8220;entities&#8221; (people, places, organizations, terms, etc) mentioned in text. You can even add custom key/value pairs to a document and then search against those. And of course, both these features are accessible through the API, making it easy to tap this incredible toolset with nothing more than a simple GET request.</li>
<li><strong>Generate a timeline from dates in a document. </strong>Did I lose you at &#8216;API&#8217;? Don&#8217;t worry! There&#8217;s an even easier way to use structured data extracted by OpenCalais. DocumentCloud automatically generates a timeline based on dates found in your document.</li>
<li><strong>Manage a large collection of </strong><strong>documents. </strong>DocumentCloud is great for analyzing a single document, but it&#8217;s especially handy when you want to examine a large collection of documents (like 24,000 pages of <a title="NY Times' Palin emails" href="http://projects.nytimes.com/palin-emails/date/2006-12-04" target="_blank">Sarah Palin&#8217;s emails</a>, for instance). DocumentCloud makes it easy to embed a collection, create a timeline, or extract entities from a set of documents. Combined with the product’s collaborative functionality, the result is a tool that is very helpful for newsrooms tackling major reporting projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;d like access to the tool, which is available only to journalists, <a href="mailto:info@documentcloud.org?subject=joining">email DocumentCloud</a> and ask your editor to do the same. All they require is permission to include participating newsrooms on <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/contributors">their list of document contributors</a>.</p>
