		<description><![CDATA[This month's Thunderdome MVP honor goes to sports editor Gary Kicinski for his leadership of Digital First Media's 2014 Olympics coverage.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300" /></p><p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7603" alt="Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300.jpeg" width="300" height="300" /></a>If a gold medal were to be given out for <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/05/expansive-winter-olympics-coverage-digital-media-websites/" target="_blank">Digital First Media&#8217;s national coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics</a>, we&#8217;d have to give it to the guy who led the show: Thunderdome sports editor <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/gkicinski/" target="_blank">Gary Kicinski</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no such gold medal, so Gary will have to settle for this month&#8217;s Thunderdome MVP/Under the Radar award. It&#8217;s not as shiny, but it does come with a $5 Starbucks gift card.</p>
<p>The Thunderdome Olympics desk received recognition earlier this month, winning <a title="Thunderdome’s 24/7 Olympics desk earns the cross-team gold" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/04/thunderdomes-247-olympics-desk-earns-cross-team-gold/" target="_blank">Thunderdome&#8217;s cross-team collaboration award</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The nomination</strong>: Thunderdome’s MVP is voted on each month by a panel of anonymous judges. Anyone can be nominated by anyone on staff. Gary was nominated for the award by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mwalks" target="_blank">sports producer Matt Walks</a>, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>On behalf of the team that tackled the Olympics, I just wanted to take a second to nominate Gary for MVP because of the way he made such a daunting event easy (and fun) to cover literally all hours of the day. Juggling the needs of all of our properties wasn&#8217;t easy, nor was making sure we producers didn&#8217;t lose our sanity. From Mission Control to Kelly and both Chrises, it was truly a team effort, but we couldn&#8217;t have done what we did without Gary.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The other nominees</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/jsederholm" target="_blank"><strong>Jillian Sederholm</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/phogan" target="_blank">Patrick Hogan</a>, who said: &#8220;When the news came out that Facebook was adding more gender options, we originally were going to wait for an official list to come out. It was Jillian who discovered how to get Facebook to display the list in profile options and who <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-living/ci_25134487/here-are-facebooks-56-gender-identity-options" target="_blank">got the list out while</a> everyone else was still reporting the original announcement.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/kmetz" target="_blank"><strong>Kelly Metz</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/marklewis" target="_blank">Mark Lewis</a>, who said: &#8220;Kelly is definitely worthy of this honor. She&#8217;s been helping me capture feeds for NewsCred, and as always she&#8217;s the type who doesn&#8217;t mind carrying water to support a project. She&#8217;s hardworking and has exactly the type of personality and work ethic we should be presenting to our newsrooms. Bonus points for being a self-starter and consistently exceeding expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mwagner" target="_blank"><strong>Meg Wagner</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/jglenza" target="_blank">Jessica Glenza</a>, who said: &#8220;She gets to Thunderdome at the crack of dawn, makes sure our pages look fresh and does an amazing job turning breaking news into rich, original content. As we all know, she also writes <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/tag/headlines" target="_blank">amazing headlines</a> and is always willing to help. Also, she looks stylish doing it. Thanks Meg, for all you do!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu" target="_blank"><strong>Nelson Hsu</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch" target="_blank">Chris March</a>. I said: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m the first person to nominate Nelson for Serendipity Day. Everyone who didn&#8217;t nominate him now owes the contest committee a Starbucks card. No excuses. Not only was this idea a perfect venture for Thunderdome, but the prep, organization and execution of it was super smooth. Our normal operations continued without fail while staff from all departments collaborated on some really awesome ideas that can and will have many use cases. And it appears that everyone who participated in something, learned something. That&#8217;s two birds with one stone, and Nelson threw the stone here. Bravo to his leadership and organization for seeing this through.</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/kworkman" target="_blank"><strong>Karen Workman</strong></a> was nominated by Patrick Hogan, who said: &#8220;&#8230; and the rest of the breaking news team, but mostly Karen. Karen took the chaos of a month&#8217;s worth of updates on what&#8217;s happening in Ukraine and <a href="http://dfm-master.cms.newscred.com/article/searching-for-a-diplomatic-solution-in-ukraine-and-other-updates/7c5634cfe0d24c2b895bb042a0499566" target="_blank">distilled it into a format</a> that was both very informative but also creative and engaging.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mwalks/"><strong>Matt Walks</strong></a> and <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/rmaghielse" target="_blank"><strong>Ross Maghielse</strong></a> were co-nominated by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/chopkins" target="_blank">Chris Hopkins</a>, who said: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to submit for recognition Matt Walks and Ross Maghielse, who for more than two weeks utterly demolished their Circadian rhythms in service of Digital First Media&#8217;s Olympics coverage. First one worked a 4 p.m. to midnight shift while the other worked a midnight to 8 a.m. shift, then they traded. I&#8217;ve worked some pretty weird hours during my career and even I&#8217;ve never been on the clock between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Thing to know this week</b>: Since Gary already provided some Olympics-related advice while accepting the cross-team collaboration award, he has a more general tip to share this week.</p>
<blockquote><p>Go back and check your published link!</p>
<p>It seems obvious, but too often we fail to go back and see what our published story looks like on the Web after we&#8217;ve published an article. It is easy to forget to do when sometimes it takes 15 minutes or more to show up and you&#8217;ve already moved on to another article.</p>
<p>But the reasons to do so are many, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might catch an error that wasn&#8217;t apparent to you in the editing environment.</li>
<li>You might notice a display issue that could not be presented in the preview mode (such as a byline problem, secondary photo issue, sidebar or promo box problem, etc.)</li>
<li>You might discover the publishing system is down if your article doesn&#8217;t even show up!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[Digital First Media was the first news organization to build a national database for analyzing premium costs on the health insurance exchanges set up as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Here's how, and why, we did it. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-07-at-10.52.08-AM-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-07 at 10.52.08 AM" /></p><p>Digital First Media was the first news organization to build a national database for analyzing premium costs on the health insurance exchanges set up as a result of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>This unique analysis <a href="http://www.twincities.com/nation/ci_25247140/where-insurance-premiums-are-highest-new-health-laws" target="_blank">shed light on how tax credits are making premium costs more affordable</a>, but that large disparities remain in how much consumers will actually pay simply as a result of where they live. The story, by senior data reporter<a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mwebster" target="_blank"> MaryJo Webster</a> and St. Paul Pioneer Press health care reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissnowbeck" target="_blank">Chris Snowbeck</a>, and the interactive map, by DFM news apps developer <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/vhagery" target="_blank">Vaughn Hagerty</a>, published Feb. 28.</p>
<p>Here’s some insight into how we did it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you think this was worth pursuing?<br />
</strong><em></em></p>
<div id="attachment_7096" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/cst_Chris_Snowbeck_1_.jpeg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-7096" alt="Chris Snowbeck, St. Paul Pioneer Press" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/cst_Chris_Snowbeck_1_-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chris Snowbeck, St. Paul Pioneer Press</p></div>
<p><em>Chris Snowbeck</em>: In covering the launch of the Minnesota exchange, we found there were significant premium disparities between the Twin Cities, Rochester, Minn., and nearby western Wisconsin. He compared the &#8220;benchmark&#8221; premium — a 50-year-old, non-smoker, buying the second-lowest-cost silver tier policy — to the same figures for the states in the federal exchange. That comparison showed the rating area encompassing the Twin Cities had the lowest premiums, while Rochester and an area of western Wisconsin just a short drive from St. Paul were both among the highest.</p>
<p>This raised two big questions that could only be answered with a complete national dataset: Would this hold true if we looked at the entire United States? And who would get the &#8220;better deal&#8221; — the consumer in the Twin Cities with low premiums and little chance of getting a federal tax credit, or the consumer in the higher-cost places that will benefit from the subsidies?</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you collect the data?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_6794" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/MaryJo-Webster_avatar_1391182151-300x300.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6794" alt="MaryJo Webster" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/MaryJo-Webster_avatar_1391182151-300x300-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">MaryJo Webster, Digital First Media</p></div>
<p><strong></strong><em>MaryJo Webster:</em> The data for the states in the federal exchange was nicely packaged in an Excel file that the Department of Health and Human Services had posted online. Collecting data for the 15 states that run their own exchanges was a bit harder. Once we figured out the correct terminology when making our request, this wasn’t as hard as we first suspected. Numerous public relations officials told us others had been requesting the same data. In some states, we had to go to the agency that regulates insurance; in other places, we got the information from the exchange.</p>
<p>We didn’t have to file official public records requests; there were a couple states that simply asked for a written request, though. A surprising number of states had this information on their website (although, not always easy to find).</p>
<p><strong>Q: What did you ask for?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: We decided to request, at minimum, the same thing that had been provided in the data for the federal exchange. That data showed the lowest-cost premium for each metal tier (bronze, silver, gold, platinum), in each rating area for individual consumers (not families and not those getting insurance through their employer). In most cases, we obtained a base rate and used age multiplier tables — also provided by the states — to calculate the premiums at each of the 45 age points used by the exchanges. We also made sure to get the second lowest-cost silver premium for each age and rating area. This is used as part of the calculation to determine how much tax credit a consumer would get. Several states gave us premiums for every product available on their exchanges, and we pulled out the lowest-cost for each metal tier and the second lowest-cost silver premium. The hardest part of all this was that most of the data from the state-run exchanges came in PDFs that had to be dumped out to Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you analyze this data?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: Our goal was to determine what people at various ages, income levels and geographies would pay for health insurance premiums after federal tax credits were applied for those eligible. For individuals, the general rule is that you would be eligible for a tax credit if your income is at or below 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold. In the contiguous United States, that amounts to about $45,960 per year (it’s higher in Alaska and Hawaii). With such a massive amount of data, we knew we had to focus at least a little. So we chose to look at how the premiums and tax credits would play out for consumers buying the lowest-cost silver plan available to them. We chose the silver tier because enrollment data in the federal exchange show 60 percent of consumers are choosing silver tier plans.</p>
<p>We ran calculations to estimate the tax credit and ultimate consumer cost (plus what percentage of their income that would be) for people at key income points between 200 and 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold. We also calculated cost as a percentage of income at 401 percent of poverty, and other income levels that are above the threshold for tax credit eligibility.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What difficulties did you encounter?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: Initially, we were told that the tax credit calculation relied on the second lowest-cost silver plan for the rating area. Later after completing data collection, we found out there are places where there are different second lowest-cost silvers within a rating area. Typically, this is a case where one or more insurance plans are only offered in certain counties within the rating area.</p>
<p>We decided to stick with running our tax credit calculations at the rating area level, partly because there aren’t too many places where there are differences within a rating area, and the ones that do exist typically have premium variations of less than $25 per month.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The project includes an interactive map comparing costs in the 501 rating areas across the U.S. How did you decide what to include?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: The map does not include all of our data points; instead it allows users to compare costs for certain ages at key income levels. We figured putting all of the data into the interactive would be a little overwhelming and unnecessary. The goal is to show the general trends, not to provide specific costs for every scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What technology did you use to make the interactive map?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_7097" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Vaughn-Hagerty_avatar_1380631225-300x300.jpeg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-7097" alt="Vaughn Hagerty, Digital First Media" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Vaughn-Hagerty_avatar_1380631225-300x300-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Vaughn Hagerty, Digital First Media</p></div>
<p><em>Vaughn Hagerty:</em> The foundation for the interactive is Google maps and custom JavaScript. A key challenge for this interactive was to manage the amount of data involved: We didn’t want to have files so large that they’d make the app too slow to load or balky.</p>
<p>To create the shapes of the rating areas, we used ArcGIS to dissolve county-level maps (or in some cases, ZIP-code or city-level maps) and then stitch all of those back together into a national shapefile. Then we converted the shapefile to KML (Keyhole Markup Language, a geography-specific XML variant), and used PHP to pare that down into much smaller JavaScript files. The rating data also was converted to a JavaScript format aimed at minimizing file size for more than 35,000 records.</p>
<p>We had two goals for the app: Show some specific examples that illustrate how rates vary and allow users to explore the overall map to see variations nationwide or for specific regions.</p>
<p>For the first we created a “tour” that guided people through a number of examples throughout the country. For the second, we built tools to let people filter the data by certain age and income groups to see how those affect costs. We grouped those costs into four “buckets,” ranges that determined what color the rating area would be on the map for certain age and income criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What should we expect next year when consumers are shopping for 2015 insurance coverage?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Snowbeck</em>: Experts told us some of these disparities might be a quirk that’s simply the result of this being the first year. Insurance companies might have set premiums higher or lower than usual because of uncertainty about who would purchase plans through these exchanges. As a result, it’s quite likely that we’ll see an entirely different picture at the end of this year when rates are set for 2015 insurance policies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/20140304__0305joebell3-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="WWII veteran, Joe Bell, 95, became a viral video Internet sensation after Mercury News writer Julia Prodis-Sulek posted a Tout video of the spontaneous tributes Bell received while he stood in front of his home cheering on participants during the annual Pat Tillman running race. (Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group)" /></p><p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/g85kk7" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reasonable chance that you or someone you know has seen this video. It shows runners breaking off in the middle of a race to thank World War II veteran Joe Bell for his service. Bell was watching the race in uniform from the sidewalk outside his home.</p>
<p>Since the video went online Sunday, it has been picked up by dozens of media outlets — including Yahoo&#8217;s front page, Good Morning America, The Today Show and ESPN — and racked up more than one million shares online.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, the online clip had logged more than 1.2 million views. To put that in perspective, all of Digital First Media&#8217;s Tout accounts logged just over 1.8 million views in all of February. Suffice it to say, this video is a bona fide viral sensation, especially in the San Jose community.</p>
<p>The viral nature of this video is even more remarkable when you consider that the reporter who captured it, <a href="https://twitter.com/juliasulek" target="_blank">Julia Prodis Sulek</a> of the <a href="http://mercurynews.com" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, was not on assignment. She was in her house, watching the moment unfold from her window, when she realized it needed to be captured and shared.</p>
<p>She explains in an email to Inside Thunderdome:</p>
<blockquote><p>I woke up to the sounds of the runners in the morning. I looked out my window and wondered why some of them were running on the sidewalk. I looked down the street and saw Joe Bell in uniform with runners shaking his hand. I was so touched and wondered whether I should run out in my fuzzy pink bathrobe. I put clothes on instead, figuring I had missed the moment anyway, and ran outside. It was a lull at the time, but with Joe cheering people on, others cheered him back. So I started filming that. And amazingly, one runner peeled off to shake his hand, then another and another. What I loved about the tribute to Joe is that those tributes kept coming in waves throughout the race. It wasn&#8217;t like a long procession with everyone following each other. It would stop, then organically start up again. Loved it, and happy to have captured it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps what makes the video so appealing to viewers around the country is that it captures a raw moment of heart-warming honesty. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_25271319/wwii-vet-becomes-viral-video-star-san-jose-tribute" target="_blank">In this followup story</a>, Matt Bell (Joe&#8217;s son) tells Julia, &#8221;There was nothing staged about it. It was an honest response from honest people. We don&#8217;t see that too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some clips of Julia and Joe recounting the moment. These were filmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/garyjreyes" target="_blank">Gary Reyes</a>, also of the San Jose Mercury News.</p>

<p>Joe Bell explains what encouraged him to go outside and watch the race from the sidewalk. &#8220;At 95, you like to see people, you know?&#8221;</p>

(Photo by Chris Detrick/The Salt Lake Tribune)" /></p><p>The Olympic sport of biathlon combines the skills of cross-country skiing with rifle shooting.</p>
<p>Thus, relatively speaking, it didn&#8217;t seem quite so bizarre when we decided to combine a features producer, a community engagement manager, our world news channel manager and four sports staffers into a 24/7 desk to produce <a href="http://dfm.denverpost.com/olympics" target="_blank">Olympics content</a> for <a title="Expansive Winter Olympics coverage for Digital First Media websites" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/05/expansive-winter-olympics-coverage-digital-media-websites/" target="_blank">11 channels</a> to 70-plus DFM sites over 17 days.</p>

<p><strong>The winner</strong><br />
That eclectic group is February&#8217;s winner of Thunderdome&#8217;s cross-team collaboration award. (<a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/04/kitchen-pop-team-secures-win/" target="_blank">Last month&#8217;s award went to &#8220;Kitchen Pop.</a>&#8220;)</p>
<p>In his nomination, sports producer <a href="http://insidethundedome.com/author/mwalks" target="_blank">Matt Walks</a> noted that the team produced about 500 pieces of content during the games and maintained an always-active liveblog. The team worked directly with reporters in Russia, which Matt said &#8220;helped increase awareness and understanding of Thunderdome throughout our realm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sports borrowed <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/kmetz" target="_blank">Kelly Metz</a> from Features and <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch" target="_blank">Chris March</a> from our engagement desk to steer the liveblog on weekdays, and they kept readers abreast of the action in Sochi during the busiest part of the day, which coincided with our peak traffic period. The <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a> blog racked up 1.6 million engagement minutes during the Olympics.</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/chopkins" target="_blank">Chris Hopkins</a> brought his experienced editing eye from the news desk over to sports, where he teamed with Matt Walks, <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/jbinckes" target="_blank">Jeremy Binckes</a>, <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/rmaghielse" target="_blank">Ross Maghielse</a> and <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/jneukamm" target="_blank">Johannes Neukamm</a> to showcase the work of reporters and photographers from the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com" target="_blank">Denver Post</a>, the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, the <a href="http://sltrib.com" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tribune</a> and the <a href="http://www.twincities.com" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Tip of the week<br />
</strong>When planning coverage for a big event such as the Olympics that requires coordination of efforts from multiple properties, Too Much Information is a good thing. In short, <em>overshare</em>.</p>
<p>In preparing for the Olympics, we organized weekly phone calls with top editors to keep them abreast of development plans and to seek their input on coverage approaches. These phone calls were followed up by e-mail recaps, and those recaps were stored in a Google doc accessible to all. Why the redundancies?</p>
<ul>
<li>Carpet-bombing technique catches editors who couldn&#8217;t make a call or may have been distracted during a call.</li>
<li>Digital record helps clarify any confusing points, establishes a record of conversation and followup plans.</li>
<li>Reinforcement makes it easier to recall key coverage points and keep everybody on track, resulting in less time being devoted to retracing old ground.</li>
</ul>

The result got some laughs, and a tweet from Jimmy Fallon." /></p><p>This is the story of two videos: the one that was supposed to happen, and the one that did.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Head southwest on Saugerties Manor toward Highway 32 north New York 212 West New York 32 North route 32 North state 32 North state highway 32 North state route 32 North.”<br />
- Google Maps</p></blockquote>
<p>Those were the instructions as we (<a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/yleow" target="_blank">Yvonne Leow</a>, <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/sglen" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a> and myself) arrived in Saugerties, NY, on a brief road trip from Manhattan. The little smartphone voice commanded it twice when all we were hoping for was &#8220;turn right.&#8221; Or maybe left? We laughed it off because we weren’t yet aware of Google&#8217;s abilities to give life lessons through metaphor; I think it’s still in beta. And through indecipherable and logically inverted geographic nonsensery, our apoplectic maps app omnisciently hinted at the twists and turns of the days to follow. And we guessed right, which turned out to be correct.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/131232026&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true" height="166" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>It seemed so simple</strong><br />
We entered into this project with the goal of exploring Jimmy Fallon’s roots, and we took advantage of the proximity of our Manhattan headquarters to Fallon’s hometown. We rented a car and drove upstate to talk to locals about his life before Late Night. But we wanted to do this in a more interesting way than usual. So we decided to forgo the standard interview style video and instead make a parody of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4&amp;feature=kp" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon’s popular Late Night sketch, slow jam the news</a> — with all appropriate historical interview info in place. Piece of cake, right?</p>
<p><strong>The first problem: Less time than anticipated</strong><br />
Sarah pre-interviewed the teachers before we arrived, and we began incorporating their stories into a rough draft of the script the day before the shoot. But we didn’t have a chance to finish by the time we checked into the hotel, just before midnight. When we finally called it quits, at around 4 or 5 a.m., we still had some shooting logistics to figure out. We discovered earlier in the day that there was no way to get more than 40 minutes with the students. For a shoot that we would never budget less than four hours for, not including location scout and setup, we had the length of one high school class period to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>The second problem: Much larger cast than anticipated</strong><br />
We arrived about an hour early to get a look at our location, and to unload our equipment. But we couldn’t do much else, as there was a class in our room right before the shoot. On top of that, the 3-4 musicians from the high school band we were hoping for turned into about 50-60. You can imagine how this changed the scale of the composition of what was supposed to be a single shot done in one take. Not to mention our ability to actually hear our teachers talking. That’s a whole lot of high school band.</p>
<p>But these kids were excited. All 50+ of them turning around approval forms from their parents overnight. One of them even made Mr. Fallon a big sign that read &#8220;Jimmy Fallon you make us Smile.&#8221; You’ll recognize it as the happy face turned creepy face at the closing of the video. And our slow jammers, the two brave non-actor teachers tasked with the responsibility of getting through some lengthy cue cards at eight o’clock in the morning — they had very little time to &#8220;get in character.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The first take (sort of)</strong><br />
After half of one take, we had to cut. It was impossible to hear the teachers through the band, our timing with the cue cards was way off, the planned camera moves and focus shifts were failing, and it was clear that we needed to talk through the material with our cast. We made the decision on the spot to record the band completely separately, and then have them mime their performance behind the teachers when we filmed their dialogue. While the students recorded the slow jam version of their high school song, we took the teachers aside and walked them through the finer points of the script. We coached them and gave them pointers, mostly line reads and explanations of the jokes that may have gone over their heads otherwise. We suggested points of emphasis and some basic stage direction and we returned to our shooting location with less than 10 minutes to finish.</p>
<p><strong>The only full take</strong><br />
We did one complete take of the entire script. That’s all we had time for. Under ideal conditions we would’ve shot them many times, as many as possible, and would’ve gone in from the wide shot to grab doubles and singles to edit in if the one take idea wasn’t working. But we only got one chance before the bell rang and the period was over. Fortunately, our teachers didn’t have a class next period.</p>
<p>Yvonne, Sarah and myself stepped out into the hallway for a quick pow-wow. It was very evident that at that point we did not have what we needed to make a good video. And since we just lost our giant room full of kids, we didn’t have a lot to fall back on. But, maybe because the cafeteria coffee was starting to kick in, we continued to roll with the punches and decided to shoot close-ups of the teachers, even though the kids were gone. One advantage we had was the big smiley face that one of the students created. That smiley was being waved around in the background during the one take we shot. And it became the only movement and visual link to someone else in the room during our close-ups.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much else we could do after that. We got what we got. It was in the can. We spent the rest of the afternoon running around grabbing b-roll of the high school and town. As part of the parody, the idea was to make a cool, Tonight Show-like opening. Flashy shots of Main Street would whip into a busy school hallway and smash-zoom into Fallon’s yearbook photo — all to an upbeat soundtrack and covered with slick graphics. Easy enough.</p>
<p><strong>We almost scrapped it</strong><br />
Comedy, as anyone who has ever attempted it knows, is one of the hardest things to pull off successfully. It’s very subjective. And with our rushed-script, non actors, and compromised production schedule, we were set up for failure. The first time I looked at the footage I decided to come up with a pseudonym for myself. There was no way my name was going on this. I reported back to Yvonne that it might be worse than we thought it was. But she encouraged me to try and string something together. To see if there’s anything good in there at all.</p>
<p><strong>A different video emerges</strong><br />
The longer I stared at the footage, that long raw take, the more flaws I found. It was always the plan to intentionally shoot it in a sort of low budget, community TV-style — the idea being that we could never pull off Tonight Show-level production with our limited crew and equipment. So we embraced our shortcomings. And I started paying more attention to those little looks the teachers gave between cut and action in the close ups. That was the key. While the camera was still rolling between takes, it caught our kind subjects in moments of strict attention, dismissal, exasperation, laughter, frustration, boredom and whatever else could be interpreted via the license creative. Those reaction shots became something I could work with. The moments the teachers weren’t acting, quickly became some of my favorite moments.</p>
<p>I made the decision to take this train wreck and drag it back and forth across the tracks. If this was going to be bad, it was going to be real bad. Every edit from that point forth was made with the highly committed goal of mining humor where there otherwise was none, utilizing the formula: Bad = good. Finding the painfully awkward moments, and turning them into funny awkward moments. The band was recorded separately, and their track didn’t synch. Who cares! In the close up shots it was obvious that the students had vanished. Big deal! The written jokes weren’t landing, but the non-written moments in between were.</p>
<p>I laughed to myself often as I cut this. My team saw me, and I know it gave them some hope that maybe something good was coming. But I really wasn’t sure. I was in that zone somewhere between when you’re really tired and everything is funny, and that feeling of when all is lost and there’s nothing left to lose. So I couldn’t tell if what I was doing was actually funny, or just funny to me. But I kept trusting that initial impulse of bad = good. And that the weird little choices would be funny to at least some small, strange segment of humanity.</p>
<p>Once the slow jam part of the project was finished, there was no way I could build the slick and complex opening sequence we had planned. Our revised opening had to be as low rent as the rest of the piece, or it would stand out in the wrong way. It needed bad fonts, an off-putting Sears portait-style floating Fallon, and random jazz music to cap the absurdity.</p>
<p>The first few people watched and, surprisingly, they all laughed at the right places. They acknowledged that this was, in fact, odd, but laughing cannot be argued. Several people pointed out potential errors, like bad lip synch, inaccurate graphics, and typos &#8211; all of which were intentional. The quick answer to the question of “is it supposed to be like that” became: yes. Bad = good. So people got it &#8230; mostly. And they stood behind it. I didn’t use a pseudonym, and the piece went out like it was always supposed to be that way.</p>
<p><strong>The final result</strong><br />
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QiCZnoqunnw" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
What we ended up with feels like a strangely authentic and sweet look at a public high school arts program paying homage to one of their own. Our experience through the project was an unexpected and meandering path of many wrong turns, much like our Google Maps welcome to Saugerties. But we did arrive, eventually, and Jimmy Fallon even Tweeted the video the next day. So yeah, the people of Saugerties High are Twitter-famous now.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Here&#8217;s a funny slow jam from my high school. Well done, Sawyers! <a href="http://t.co/JrLrvMczA3">http://t.co/JrLrvMczA3</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23saugerties&amp;src=hash">#saugerties</a></p>

<p>And THAT is how we slow-jammed Jimmy Fallon.</p>

The DFMie winners here include <a href="https://twitter.com/nsmithdt" target="_blank"><strong>Noel Lyn Smith</strong></a> of the Daily Times in Farmington, N.M., <a href="https://twitter.com/nhglasier" target="_blank"><strong>David S.

<p>Glasier&#8217;s text story and Blair&#8217;s video story about <a href="http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20131201/northeast-ohio-suburbanites-falling-prey-to-heroins-pull-in-deadly-ways-with-video" target="_blank">heroin addiction in the Northeast Ohio suburbs</a> won the fourth straight Midwest DFMie for the News-Herald (others were shared with the Morning Journal).</p>
<p>This is the fourth DFMie for local coverage of heroin addiction, an issue recently underscored nationally by news of the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_25046830/philip-seymour-hoffman-found-dead-nyc-apartment" target="_blank">death of Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what judges said about Glasier and Blair&#8217;s work:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Excellent use of video. Nice story about someone who seemed to be a normal person that took the wrong path with drugs. The story was real, about someone you might know that lived next door.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Another judge:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>They covered the problem from all perspectives, including interviews with users, police, family members, and mental health professionals, and packaged it with several videos.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Blair&#8217;s reflection on the story:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This award got me thinking about that teamwork and how important it is to our success as a newsroom. You see, David and I are very green. I don’t mean green in the sense of being new to the business, I mean green in that we like to carpool to assignments. It seems that the best ideas arise from the time we spend in the car en route to our assignments. We&#8217;re constantly hashing a plan and strategizing how to best tackle the challenges before us in multiple platforms. It doesn’t hurt that we’re also saving our sources valuable time and the company mileage. Fact is, it’s a great way to brainstorm ideas.</p>
<p>We appreciate each other&#8217;s skill set and realize how much better we can tackle challenges as a team. Whether it’s David’s ability to ace a reporter standup for a video intro or my ability to provide an unexpected follow-up question during a subject interview, we keep the lines of communication open and it’s a very collaborative process right through the final edit. David’s background in TV and broadcasting is a real asset to our Digital First strategy. Our approach is simple: we trust and respect each other&#8217;s skills and relish all the new tools of the trade.</p>
<p>It’s often surprising how different our needs can be for the written story versus visuals for a video story. Our success as a team depends on our ability to recognize the different moving parts of the story and work together to get what we need for the project to come to life both in print and online.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Glasier added:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Every story offers its own journey. This journey was particularly harrowing as it took us into the worlds of law enforcement, heroin users, clinical professionals, coroners and families hit hard by this heroin epidemic.</p>
<p>From a structural point of view, Michael and I throughout the reporting process were diligent in combining the elements of written word, still photography and video to tell the story.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Noel Lyn Smith wins for breaking story of misused funds</h3>
<div id="attachment_6612" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/noel_lyn_smith/" rel="attachment wp-att-6612"><img class=" wp-image-6612 " alt="Noel Lyn Smith" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/noel_lyn_smith-300x200.jpg" width="270" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Noel Lyn Smith</p></div>
<p>Coverage of criminal indictments normally fits under breaking news, but we include this among the enterprise winners because the <a href="http://www.daily-times.com/four_corners-news/ci_24667111/former-current-navajo-nation-council-members-accused-misusing" target="_blank">Daily Times broke the story</a>.</p>
<p>Smith wins the Texas/New Mexico cluster DFMie for breaking the story and for excellence in her continuing coverage of the case.</p>
<p>She got the court record through sources and the Times posted it online, reporting the criminal indictments of bribery and conspiracy against members of the Navajo Nation Council, including Speaker Johnny Naize. The Navajo Times linked to the Daily Times story, and Smith stayed in front of the continuing story, which included an effort to depose Naize.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Here is what judges said about Smith&#8217;s reporting:</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I give Noel credit for breaking the story through good reporting. I also see that the community responded well, judging by the nearly 2,000 in Facebook shares &#8212; a huge number for any newspaper in a place like Farmington. I also like how the newspaper made sure to put the criminal summons on the website. The story really shows the depth of alleged corruption in the Navajo Nation. It&#8217;s pretty incredible. It&#8217;s good for members to know what their leaders were up to. I also think it says a lot about the reporting that it was followed by AP, as well as his own newspaper&#8217;s editorials.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And another:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m really impressed with Noel&#8217;s work. I know how hard it can be to penetrate into tribal issues, and this is a great piece. As a reader from out of the area I appreciated the way the story was broken up, with subheads for the major players&#8211;made it very easy to follow.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Smith shares this advice:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Good record keeping helps, especially if the story involves an ongoing court case. If a law is cited in a motion filed in court or in a decision made by a judge, I find it helpful to research that citation in order to gain a better understanding and to pass that information onto readers.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bay Area News Group wins for its examination of viral videos</h3>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/S1byolwlhck" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The nomination explains &#8220;<a title="How Tech Redefines Us" href="http://extras.mercurynews.com/redefined/fame/index.html">How Tech Redefines Us</a>,&#8221; the creative project that won the Bay Area News Group&#8217;s DFMie:</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you become famous in the Internet age? Go viral, of course. As part of our exploration of how technology is redefining everyday lives, we decided to see if we have what it takes. Our vehicle for possible fame: the iChicken! Bay Area News Group staffers wrote, starred in and recorded a parody of Apple’s product commercials, featuring chickens who are the object of their owners’ obsession, even as the world proceeds around them. We could describe it further, but it’s better to watch videographer LiPo Ching’s work (above): Reporter Patrick May wove the tale of the iChicken video, and our relentless efforts to boost its popularity, into an article examining the meaning of online fame: who gets it, who doesn’t, what it’s worth. Spoiler alert: We didn’t go viral. And, painfully, we examine why and what it tells us about the cruel, modern, digital world.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Judges praised the report:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>They tackle this issue with humor and creativity. Their video was fun and they lost no overall credibility by doing so. A serious conversation about what goes viral, even with them leaving the conversation open ended (as it has to be), didn&#8217;t leave me feeling any less informed or entertained.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Another judge:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The videos were engaging, the story itself flowed, and the layout of the content was simple and effective. I really appreciated all the work that went into the moving parts. I thought the iChicken video, ridiculous as that idea was, was a brilliant concept. I think many of us wonder how videos go viral, so BANG&#8217;s attempt to make that happen, and then dissect the process for the story, was really interesting. The video was quite sophisticated, even if the subject was silly.</p>
<p>I liked the variety of tools used to display information. I liked the little info boxes, like &#8220;Big moments in FAME,&#8221; and &#8220;The viral stuff.&#8221; They really broke the information into manageable pieces, and that kept my attention as I moved through the content.</p>
<p>The digital layout was really easy to use, and kept my eye moving. Although I focused on evaluating the Fame section of the series, I thought the series as a whole was really awesome. There were so many click-able elements in a really sleek design. Great job.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cue the Olympics theme song.</p>
<p>With the flick of a switch on Jan. 29 (in reality it&#8217;s more complicated than that), Digital First Media rolled out 10 Olympics &#8220;subchannels&#8221; across 70+ Websites, providing readers of DFM properties with comprehensive coverage as we draw nearer to the start of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, Feb. 7.</p>
<p>That sweeping move has more than tripled the number of Thunderdome-powered channels from 4 to 14. Previously we launched channels for <a href="http://dfm.mercurynews.com/health" target="_blank">Health</a>, <a href="http://dfm.ydr.com/nation" target="_blank">Nation</a>, <a href="http://dfm.insidebayarea.com/world" target="_blank">World </a>and the <a href="http://dfm.theoaklandpress.com/olympics" target="_blank">main Olympics channel</a>.</p>
<p>This puts us in position to easily deliver 24/7 Olympics coverage to DFM local audiences, produced once from Thunderdome with no local intervention necessary.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6554 alignright" alt="promo" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/promo.jpg" width="98" height="101" /><strong>Where to find the Olympics channel on DFM sites</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/spmediaday_2jl7530x-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) answers questions during the team&#039;s Media Day Tuesday at the Prudential Center. (Photo by John Leyba/The Denver Post)" /></p><p>The DFM Super Bowl between the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers didn&#8217;t materialize (maybe next year, San Jose Mercury), but the Broncos still made it to New York, and DFM resources are being mobilized en masse to bring comprehensive coverage of Super Bowl XLVIII to the DFM audience.</p>
<p>The Denver Post has set up shop in the Big Apple to lead the way for DFM, launching a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/superbowl" target="_blank">Super Bowl XLVIII index page</a> that spotlights twice-daily live streaming programs, blogs, photos, video and more.</p>
<p>Denver&#8217;s massive effort is aided by staffers from Thunderdome, the <a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a> and <a href="http://delcotimes.com" target="_blank">Delaware County Times</a>, and supplemented by coverage from properties such as the <a href="http://trentonian.com" target="_blank">Trentonian</a>, the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, the <a href="http://dailynews.com" target="_blank">Los Angeles Daily News</a> and the <a href="http://sltrib.com" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p>
<p>Thunderdome is assembling the best of that content and packaging it up Digital First Media properties in three primary fashions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_24988477/super-bowl-2014-seattle-seahawks-vs-denver-broncos" target="_blank">Rebel Mouse page</a>, which serves as an index to the best features and most important news stories.</li>
<li>A Super Bowl display group, offered to properties for placement on their sites, containing a steady stream of news, with the Rebel Mouse index page pinned to the top of the container.</li>
<li>A takeover of the middle section of The Bottom Line for the week, spotlighting more buzz-worthy or interesting off-the-field Super Bowl-related content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the content highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live programming</strong>: Daily streaming video shows produced by The Post from 9-11 a.m. ET and 5-7 p.m. ET, running through Friday.</li>
<li><strong>Photos and video</strong>: Produced by Photodome. Check your local <a href="http://photos.denverpost.com/category/sports/broncos/super-bowl/" target="_blank">Media Center</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Interactives</strong>: Produced by Thunderdome, these will include our <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/digital-first-media/ci_24979996/raise-stakes-super-bowl-trash-talk-generator" target="_blank">Trash Talk Generator</a>; our <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_24997179/predictor-tool-helps-you-figure-out-broncos-seahawks" target="_blank">Predictor Tool</a>; a multi-part package analyzing five years of Super Bowl commercials, including a searchable/sortable database and illustrated graphic; and a Halftime Match Game.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">There&#8217;s little time to catch one&#8217;s breath after the Super Bowl either — the Winter Olympics begin just five days later. We&#8217;ll share some details on our Olympics coverage next week right here on Inside Thunderdome. </span></p>

<p>Pasche finished with a record of 172-83 (.675), beating out <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeOGorman" target="_blank">George O&#8217;Gorman of the Trentonian</a> (170-85, .667) by two correct picks.</p>
<p>For comparison, Pasche would have beaten 12 of the 13 experts on <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/picks/_/week/17/seasontype/2" target="_blank">ESPN&#8217;s panel</a>, with only Ron Jaworski (174-81, .682) managing a record better than Pasche. She also would have beaten all eight of the human experts at <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/features/writers/expert/picks/straight-up/17" target="_blank">CBSSports.com</a>, and tied for first among the eight experts at <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/01/03/staff-picks-wild-card-playoffs-2013-awards/4305917/" target="_blank">USATODAY.com</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My &#8216;secret formula&#8217; involved looking at the spread, the home team, and then going mostly with my gut. And, of course, a lot of luck,&#8221; Pasche said.</p>
<p>All six of the DFM writers also contributed a &#8220;Lock of the Week&#8221; in Tout video form, with Pasche relying on her <a href="http://www.tout.com/m/gf1m2i" target="_blank">magic apple tree</a> as inspiration for many of her sure-fire bets.</p>

<p>Our other four prognosticators were <a href="https://twitter.com/MercPurdy" target="_blank">Mark Purdy</a> of the San Jose Mercury News, <a href="https://twitter.com/BobGrotz" target="_blank">Bob Grotz</a> of the Delaware County Daily Times, <a href="https://twitter.com/jsbrownsinsider" target="_blank">Jeff Schudel</a> of the northern Ohio News-Herald and <a href="https://twitter.com/merganser10" target="_blank">Dave Pevear</a> of the Lowell Sun.</p>
<p>The predictions app was designed by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu" target="_blank">Nelson Hsu</a>, built by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/vhagerty/" target="_blank">Vaughn Hagerty</a> and <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/sglen/" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a>, and managed by <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mwalks/" target="_blank">Matt Walks</a> at Thunderdome.</p>
<p>With the regular season having concluded, our experts have kindly agreed to continue making their picks through the postseason, so watch for their playoff and Super Bowl predictions on a DFM site near you.</p>
