		<description><![CDATA[Jessica Glenza won the DFMie as Journalist of the Year in small-daily newsrooms for her reporting at the Register Citizen in Torrington, Conn.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Jessica-Glenza-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Jessica Glenza" /></p><p><strong>Jessica Glenza</strong> won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">DFMie as Journalist of the Year in small-daily newsrooms</a> for her work as a reporter for the Register Citizen in Torrington, Conn.</p>
<p>As one of four Journalist of the Year winners, Glenza went into a second round of judging with new judges to select the Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. The winner of that award will be announced April 23 at the DFMies program in St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p>Glenza is now a <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-are" target="_blank">web producer at Thunderdome</a>. Her Connecticut editors’ nomination detailed her work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jessica Glenza’s tenure in Torrington was brief, but her impact was immense. Joining the staff near the beginning of 2013, her intensity was immediately felt as the quality of reporting rose in a beat that had been crucial to Torrington coverage for years. She covered a hybrid beat of crime and education because our staff is too small to have a separate reporter for each of those difficult beats.</p>
<p>Jessica immediately jumped in and broke stories that challenged officials and caused school board members to squirm under the scrutiny of true watchdog coverage.</p>
<p>The Torrington school district is more dysfunctional than most and was used to coverage from our competition, a daily paper from a nearby town with 10 times the circulation and a much larger staff, that rarely challenged what they said never asked probing questions.</p>
<p>Jessica is a natural reporter, always inquisitive, always pushing for more answers, always striving to tell the more complete story.</p>
<p>This was her first job working for a daily newspaper and she took to the constant deadlines like a seasoned veteran, producing breaking news for online, tweeting, doing write-thru versions, shooting photos, balancing multiple stories each day, all with an intense enjoyment of the job that came from her innate need to tell the stories that were not being told.</p>
<p>Soon after starting in Torrington, Jessica, with the help of co-managing editor Tom Cleary, uncovered the scandal surrounding the <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130320/victim-bullied-after-rape-allegations-against-torrington-football-players">bullying of rape victims at Torrington High School</a>. Her intrepid reporting broke a story that made national headlines and kept her a step or two ahead of coverage from CNN to the New York Times to the UK Daily Mail and countless other outlets that overran Torrington in the wake of that scandal.</p>
<p>That was the most high-profile example, but her reporting was just as solid on every story she produced in 2013. She broke stories about <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/social-affairs/20130824/connecticut-struggles-to-identify-homeless-students-torrington-count-rising">homeless youth</a>, <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130322/torrington-high-school-bullying-log-records-absent-district-compliance-inconsistent-2">problems with bullying reporting in area schools</a>, excessive amounts of money spent by the Board of Education on legal fees, an extensive profile of a <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130511/winsted-man-accused-of-killing-girlfriend-13-years-ago-still-awaits-trial-while-earning-129000-a-year-in-state-job">state employee collecting a 6-figure salary for more than 13 years while awaiting trial for killing his girlfriend</a>, and many <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130913/mom-of-alleged-torrington-rape-victim-son-was-bullied-by-teammates-before-assault">more</a>.</p>
<p>All of this in a city that is notoriously tight-lipped about everything and mostly refuses to talk to media about any topic. Her persistence and investigative skills got around obstacles to produce stories that were compelling, informative, and great examples of both investigative and watchdog journalism.</p>
<p>Her intelligence, talent and intense work ethic earned her a position with DFM’s Thunderdome less than a year after starting at one of the company’s smaller daily papers.</p>
<p>Her coverage of the bullying and rape in Torrington has now been nominated for many national awards, including being submitted for consideration for a Pulitzer.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Glenza&#8217;s work earned mentions in <a href="http://jezebel.com/5991538/another-sexual-assault-victim-is-bullied-online-after-rape-allegations-against-connecticut-football-players">Jezebel</a> and <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/207965/newspaper-explains-decision-to-publish-students-tweets-about-sex-assault-case/">Poynter</a>.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Judges&#8217; comments:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Remarkable sourcing and persistence in gathering evidence in reporting some very sensitive stories. Incredible combination of methods using old and new media. Very nuanced portrayal of some potentially thorny topics. Dogged reporting to overcome administrative roadblocks in the school districts on the school districts she covered.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Register Citizen’s coverage of the rape/bullying story and related commentary also won the DFMie for public service. Those were two of four DFMies for the Connecticut newsrooms.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Rick Mills, editor of the Morning Sun in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., won the 2014 Opinion Journalism DFMie for columns challenging court secrecy.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Rick-Mills2-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Rick Mills2" /></p><p><strong>Rick Mills</strong>, editor of the Morning Sun in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank">2014 Opinion Journalism DFMie</a> for his columns challenging court secrecy.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unusual secrecy surrounding a local murder prompted Rick Mills to investigate further and find that the Clare County District Court was ignoring court rules and state Supreme Court guidelines in keeping key documents &#8212; affidavits on the evidence leading to arrests &#8212; hidden. This case remains troubling. A year later, the defendant has still not faced trial, and the lead investigator just resigned from the Clare County Sheriff&#8217;s Department. Something remains amiss.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nomination included two links:</p>
<p><a title="Clare court ignores rules, keeps key murder file secret" href="http://www.themorningsun.com/article/20130412/OPINION03/130419890">Clare court ignores rules, keeps key murder file secret</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" title="Clare courts follow the rules, seal documents" href="http://www.themorningsun.com/article/20130420/OPINION03/130429955">Clare courts follow the rules, seal documents</a></span></p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rick Mills is the best kind of columnist: not only an opinion writer, but a reporter. His detailed account of his efforts to obtain an affidavit in a murder case &#8212; a document that should have been public &#8212; takes the reader along as he faces one arrogant and incompetent authority after the other. In the end, he teaches some of these officials the fundamentals of the law, and shows the reader how basic civil rights can hang on the whim of a supposed public servant.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[Karen Workman of Thunderdome's breaking news team won the 2014 SEO Headline Writing DFMie.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/kworkman-mug-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Karen Workman" /></p><p><strong>Karen Workman</strong> of Thunderdome won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 SEO Headline Writing DFMie.</a></p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Karen Workman has emerged as a leader of Thunderdome’s efforts to publish the best possible headlines, even hosting standup meetings to enlighten and encourage her colleagues. And as deputy editor of the breaking news desk, she is able to lead by example every day.</p>
<p>Workman is a wizard at chopping headlines down to their most SEO-friendly elements, using the right phrases to maximize their effectiveness. She knows what works and will write several draft headlines, if time permits, to get the right wording. In short, she is a leader in headline-writing techniques, as the accompanying links show.</p></blockquote>
<p>These were the headlines and results submitted with her nomination:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Lupe Fiasco ushered offstage at inaugural event after anti-Obama rap</span></p>
<p>More than 22,000 page views in the early days of Thunderdome (Jan. 21, 2013)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Video of Miley Cyrus&#8217; shocking VMA performance</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Samsung&#8217;s Super Bowl ad making fun of copyright issues goes viral</span></p>
<p>Pageviews; 6,126 (Feb. 1, 2013)</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments</p>
<blockquote><p>Karen Workman is able to carefully walk the line between headlines that are SEO-friendly and headlines that are human-friendly. She uses excellent keywords, but then also uses less-than-usual but effective words that both save more space for SEO keywords AND convey more tone and content to a human reader who finds the headline with or without a search, encouraging the click. &#8220;NASCAR&#8217;s Jeff Gordon pranks unsuspecting car salesman in Pepsi video,&#8221; for example, uses &#8220;pranks&#8221; as a linchpin verb without any loss of SEO effectiveness. &#8220;Video of Miley Cyrus&#8217; shocking VMA performance&#8221; doesn&#8217;t need a verb with &#8220;shocking&#8221; in it. These headlines are both conversational AND effective, a quality that has become rare.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Jim Steinberg</strong>, <strong>Rachel Luna</strong> and <strong>Paul W. Penzella</strong> won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Special DFMie for Watchdog Journalism</a> for their project on continued contamination of drinking water in Hinkley, Calif.</p>
<p>The San Bernardino Sun project, <a title="Hinkley: a ghost town in the making" href="http://www.sbsun.com/hinkley">Hinkley: A ghost town in the making</a>, did not initially win any of the 30 2014 DFMie categories in judging March 7-8 in New York. But it was a finalist in three categories: investigative/enterprise, specialized news coverage and public service. As judges wrapped up their considerations in the final two categories, both of which the Hinkley project nearly won, they insisted that the Sun&#8217;s work should win something.</p>
<p>The judges recommended that Digital First Media award the project a special DFMie. Editor-in-Chief Jim Brady agreed to award the trio a Special DFMie for Watchdog Journalism.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the nomination for public service:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the movie, justice prevailed.</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, the residents of a small unincorporated town in the rural high desert of Southern California took on energy giant PG&amp;E. And they won.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E did poison their groundwater, and families suffered grievously. A judge ordered PG&amp;E to pay one of the largest financial penalties ever levied in a civil lawsuit. An arrogant corporation was forced to take responsibility, and the residents of Hinkley resumed their lives, triumphant in a way that makes for great cinema. Indeed, the case was made famous in the 2000 film &#8220;Erin Brockovich.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of Hinkley did not live happily ever after.</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, the toxic plume of groundwater under the remote community grew larger, not smaller, and the town itself continued to suffer. Despite ground-breaking remediation techniques and the arguable mitigation of the environmental danger, Hinkley is dying. Property values have plummeted, and the ability to earn a living is practically non-existent. Last spring, the town’s only school closed.</p>
<p>Brockovich herself has a difficult time comprehending what has happened in the years since she played a pivotal role in making PG&amp;E accountable to the people of Hinkley. “I walked away assuming that everything was OK,” she said. “I feel duped, ashamed and really sad for the people of Hinkley.”</p>
<p>In what we believe to be the most comprehensive, lucid reporting ever produced on Hinkley, the environmental disaster and its aftermath, reporter Jim Steinberg spent six months interviewing residents, experts, government officials and utility representatives to understand how Hinkley has come to such a bad end. Along the way he exhaustively sifted through thousands of pages of documents.</p>
<p>In dozens of images and videos, photojournalist Rachel Luna captured the despair and desolation that has come to characterize the community. Visual journalist Paul Penzella independently researched, reported and produced digital and print interactives and maps that illustrated publicly for the first time the scope of both the growth of the plume as well as PG&amp;E’s management tactics, which include the purchase of acres and acres of land in and around Hinkley.</p>
<p>Ultimately,The Sun published a penetrating package of stories, photographs and information graphics explaining not just what happened, but a deeper look at the science behind the attempted clean-up, the dangers of chromium-6, the depth of the community’s pain and, most importantly, the individual stories of residents.</p>
<p>The work was widely praised. Even PG&amp;E said it was the most thorough and balanced reporting it had seen done on the topic.</p>
<p>For their work bringing to light the ongoing tragedy of one of California’s most infamous environmental disasters, The Sun is proud to nominate Steinberg, Luna and Penzella for the DFMie in Public Service.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Judges&#8217; comments:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">A multimillion-dollar lawsuit and big-budget film “Erin Brockovich” in 2000 brought national attention to the plight of residents in the heavily polluted small town of Hinkley, Calif. Most assumed justice had been served. The San Bernardino Sun reminds us all that real Hollywood endings are rare, and that the problems of Hinkley residents are far from over. Beautifully written and photographed, this project is a sterling example of watchdog journalism at its very best.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This is one of five DFMies for the Los Angeles News Group.</span></p>

<p><a title="Rachel Luna" href="https://twitter.com/Rache1Luna">Luna</a> has been a multimedia journalist with the San Bernardino Sun for two years. She originally joined DFM in 2010 as a freelance photographer at the San Gabriel Valley Tribune and soon joined the staff as a weeklies reporter. She worked there for a year before moving east to cover the Inland Empire.</p>
<p>She graduated from Azusa Pacific University in 2010 with a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Liberal Studies. It was there, while working as a photo editor for the university&#8217;s newspaper, that she discovered a love for photojournalism.</p>
<p>Her most compelling and challenging assignment was visually reporting the tragic story of Hinkley. &#8220;Ironically, I was watching the movie &#8216;Erin Brockovich&#8217; a few days before I was asked to take on the project with reporter Jim Steinberg,&#8221; Luna said. &#8220;With the movie fresh in my mind, it was disturbing to learn that nearly 20 years later Hinkley residents were still being poisoned by a growing contaminated groundwater plume. ..<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">. It was hard to watch as pollution overpowered the residents of Hinkley, but I was committed to visually unveiling the grim reality of what happened to the small desert town and its residents through photos and videos.&#8221;</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Daily Camera's Charlie Brennan won the Investigative/Enterprise DFMie for small newsrooms for reporting on the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/CHARLIE+BRENNAN-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Charlie Brennan" /></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Charlie Brennan</strong> of the Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">Investigative/Enterprise DFMie for small newsrooms</a> for breaking a story that had stayed a secret for more than decade.</span></p>
<p>On Jan. 27, 2013, Brennan reported that the <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_22446410">grand jury investigating the death of JonBenet Ramsey had voted to indict her parents in 1999</a>, but the district attorney refused to prosecute.</p>
<p>Brennan’s editors’ nomination explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It had been years since we’d seen a true bombshell in Boulder’s most notorious criminal case, but this absolutely qualified as one – all thanks to the dogged investigative reporting of Charlie Brennan, who has covered the Ramsey case since Day 1.</p>
<p>Through sources that included grand jurors, Charlie was able to confirm, for the first time, that the grand jury that investigated the unsolved slaying of 6-year-old JonBenet in 1998 and 1999 secretly voted to indict the girl’s parents, on charges of child abuse resulting in death, and that the district attorney refused to prosecute them.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the end of the story.</p>
<p>Following his revelation, Charlie enlisted the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to help pursue the release of the indictment, first through open-records requests, then a lawsuit against the current DA.</p>
<p>Much to many observers’ surprise, a judge in October ordered the <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_24381455">release of the unprosecuted indictment</a>, which confirmed what we’d reported months earlier.</p>
<p>(The story on the indictment’s release was written by Mitchell Byars, since Brennan was a plaintiff – and Brennan wrote an <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_24384386">essay about why he sued for release of the indictment</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Other stories submitted as part of Brennan’s nomination:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_22446411">Legal expert: Ramsey grand jury&#8217;s vote on abuse charge possibly a &#8216;compromise&#8217;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_22446420">JonBenet Ramsey&#8217;s death a tragic, bizarre case from the start</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Charlie Brennan&#8217;s investigation into the JonBenet Ramsey case is an incredible example of the power of &#8216;staying on a story.&#8217; By developing his sources and fighting to publicly release legal documents, Brennan did an exceptional job of keeping our legal system transparent and accountable.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of two DFMies for the Camera and six for the Colorado newsrooms. The Camera and the Denver Post swept both the large-newsroom and small-newsroom DFMies for breaking news and investigative/enterprise journalism.</p>

<p>Other stops in Brennan&#8217;s career have included the Hollywood (Fla.) Sun-Tattler, the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, and KDVR Fox31 TV in Denver.</p>
<p>Brennan also collaborated with Lawrence Schiller on the New York Times best-selling account of the JonBenet Ramsey case, “<a title="Perfect Murder, Perfect Town" href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Murder-Town-Uncensored-JonBenet/dp/0061096962">Perfect Murder Perfect Town</a>.” He lives in Lafayette, Co.</p>
<h3>Other finalists</h3>
<p>Other small-newsroom finalists for the Investigative or Enterprise Journalism DFMie were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Michael Price</strong> and <strong>Kristina Scala</strong> of the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa., for their <a href="file://localhost/1.%09http/::www.dailylocal.com:social-affairs:20130923:casd-in-crisis-after-racially-charged-text-messages-surface">reporting on racist text messages by local school officials</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>The investigative or enterprise category was not divided by newsroom size in 2013, when <a title="Pioneer Press examination of public pension ‘spiking’ wins investigative journalism DFMie" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/pioneer-press-examination-public-pension-spiking-wins-investigative-journalism-dfmie/">MaryJo Webster, Mara Gottfried, Christopher Magan and C.J.

Jason’s documentary tracks the highs and lows of Miller’s journey toward robotic hands, and how faith played a role in his outlook.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;"><a title="Machete attack survivor" href="http://mediacenter.ydr.com/2013/08/10/photos-sarah-amspacher/">Machete attack survivor</a>:</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> In 2001, a man attacked a kindergarten classroom with a machete. One victim — then age 5 but now 18 — came forward from a community that had swept away the incident. With patience and empathy, Jason and a reporter drew out her memories over many months. Jason’s photojournalism was compelling, but his interviewing work is what helped bring this story to a community that could draw strength from how one of its own blossomed after a tragedy.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;"><a title="Transgender Civil War re-enactor" href="http://www.ydr.com/gettysburg150/ci_23611793">Transgender Civil War re-enactor</a>: </b><span style="font-style: italic;">Jason owned our two-week, all-out multimedia coverage of the Battle of Gettysburg’s 150th anniversary, which brought hundreds of thousands to our backyard. He produced captivating photo galleries and video stories full of action and fun. But his video of a transgender re-enactor told a serious story with an appropriate tone.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;"><a title="Burger King funeral" href="http://www.ydr.com/ci_22457374/west-york-mans-mourners-pay-him-final-tribute">Burger King funeral</a>:</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> Jason’s image of a woman placing a Whopper on her father’s casket — because the man loved fast food — resonated nationally. The image was published in major magazines, on CNN and NBC News, and earned Jason national AP photo of the month honors.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;"><a title="Touting pumpkins" href="http://www.tout.com/m/l8gtmq">Touting pumpkins</a>: </b><span style="font-style: italic;">Jason jumps on new technology. When a new social video sharing app called Tout came down from DFM, and when someone stole a local boy’s giant pumpkin — and later returned it with an apology — Jason found a creatively simple and fun way to tell the story.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;">Immediacy and engagement:</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> Jason championed a workflow using a DSLR camera and digital tablet to immediately tweet photos from the sidelines of major sporting events. The workflow has since become standard for our photographers at news scenes. He also leads seminars with local firefighters to teach the benefits of sharing news and images via Twitter, keeping their communities informed.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;">Sparking discussion: </b><span style="font-style: italic;">Jason blogs about his experiences in the field, and they usually result in great journalism debates. One post, about his encounter with a homeless woman on a sub-zero-degree morning, sparked industry conversation about the responsibilities of journalists as good citizens.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;">DART Center for Journalism and Trauma taskforce:</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> After a project about the lasting effects of a school shooting earned an honorable mention in the Dart Center’s national awards for trauma and journalism, Jason participated in a Dart panel discussion on how the project came together. He and a colleague are now working with company executives to create the groundbreaking DFM Trauma Awareness and Peer Support Program.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to winning Journalist of the Year, Plotkin was a finalist in two other categories: He and Brandie Kessler were finalists in feature/lifestyle/entertainment journalism for the story of the transgender re-enactor and his video about Paul Miller was a finalist in the long-video category.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jason Plotkin has a wonderful visual range, and a voice that can translate into different media and still match his subject. He seems to see his assignments with a sideways cock to his head: &#8220;How can I make this different? Is this better as a video? What angles would be unusual?&#8221; To say his visuals complement text would be an understatement: They do not overwhelm the text, but somehow allow the text to shine brighter. Though his medium is visual, his impact is far deeper, which makes him an excellent journalist, and journalist of the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plotkin was also a finalist in feature/entertainment/journalism and long video. Judges weren&#8217;t asked to provide comments about the finalists, but a long-video finalist volunteered this comment about Plotkin&#8217;s video:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;d like to give special recognition to Jason Plotkin of the York Daily Record for his video about Paul Miller. Plotkin did a nice job of being at the right place at the right time to capture the emotional moments of Miller&#8217;s journey that helped tell his story. It was great that he was able to spend a lot of time with Miller so we could see his story unfold.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of four DFMies for the York Daily Record and one of seven for Pennsylvania newsrooms.</p>
<p>As one of four Journalist of the Year winners, Plotkin went into a second round of judging with new judges to select the Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. The winner of that award will be announced April 23 at the DFMies program in St. Paul, Minn.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/CO_Flood-DJ-Front-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Cover of the book produced by the Daily Camera and sister newsrooms about the 2013 floods." /></p><p>The staff of the <strong>Daily Camera</strong> in Boulder, Colo., won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Breaking News DFMie</a> for its <a title="Daily Camera coverage of 2013 Boulder flood" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder-flood">coverage of September flooding</a>.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first full weekend of September 2013 along Colorado’s Front Range was remarkable only for what has become more commonplace in recent years – heat.</p>
<p>Instead, Monday marked the onset of a deluge – one the nation’s top weather experts completely missed – that increased in intensity midweek and continued in waves with little respite into the following week. It was an unprecedented and historic storm that shattered rainfall records and sparked repeated flash flooding, which led to sustained and widespread flooding that devastated communities and neighborhoods while completely isolating others.</p>
<p>The floodwaters ultimately destroyed 337 structures worth $41 million and claimed the lives of four in Boulder County.</p>
<p>It was both an exhilarating effort and an emotional, exhausting one.</p></blockquote>
<p>After a relentless round of breaking coverage in <a title="Liveblog of Boulder flood" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder-flood/ci_24074618/boulder-flooding-live-social-media-coverage-flash-flood">liveblog</a>, <a title="Breaking news coverage of Boulder flood" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder-flood/ci_24075101/boulder-flood-meteorologists-say-4-7-inches-fell">stories</a>, <a title="Daily Camera flood photo coverage" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder-flood-photo-galleries">photos</a>, <a title="Video compilation of Daily Camera flood coverage" href="http://videos.dailycamera.com/services/player/bcpid1146552157001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAAAFSLizo~,ugsvBtRv1stvvcRBKSXBdVNZS1ysEupB&amp;bctid=3091934439001">videos</a> and <a title="Daily Camera social media coverage of 2013 flood" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/2013-boulder-flood-social-media">social media</a>, the Camera&#8217;s coverage included a <a title="Daily Camera flood narrative" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder-flood/ci_24148258/boulder-county-colorado-flood-2013-survival-100-rain-100-year-flood">narrative of the flood</a>, a 56-page <a title="Special section of the Daily Camera about 2013 flood" href="http://issuu.com/prairiemountainmedia/docs/dctc_flood2013lr">special print section</a> and a 160-page photo documentary book, <a title="A Thousand-Year Rain" href="https://pediment.box.com/s/ezxbh3prsvk93b3jotrq">A Thousand-Year Rain</a>.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The (Boulder) Daily Camera is the overwhelming winner for its breaking-news coverage of the historic floods of last September. The dimensions of its coverage, both in depth and breadth, were breathtaking, and may set a new standard by which news organizations should measured when covering events of this gravity and import. Every article, photograph, video and Twitter post seemed to have as its reason for being the only thing that matters at times like this&#8211;informing the public: of the floods&#8217; danger, about how they could escape it; and what they need to do to recover from it. The totality of paper&#8217;s coverage, particularly as it concerns visual journalism, seemed to be equal to the flood in volume and force; metaphorically, it seemed to fight the flood to a draw&#8211;an impressive feat.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of two DFMies for the Daily Camera and one of six for Colorado newsrooms. The Denver Post&#8217;s flood coverage won the Breaking News DFMie for large newsrooms. The Post and Camera also swept the small- and large-newsroom DFMies for investigative or enterprise journalism.</p>
<h3>Other breaking news finalists</h3>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The Camera’s sister newsroom, the<strong> Times-Call</strong> in Longmont, was a finalist for its </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://bit.ly/M1nKRa">coverage of the same flood</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">. Matthew Jonas, Lewis Geyer, Greg Lindstrom of the Times-Call also were finalists in visual journalism for their <a title="Longmont Times-Call flood photography" href="http://photos.timescall.com/2013/09/12/photos-boulder-county-flooding-2013/#1">flood photography</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The other small-newsroom finalist in breaking news was the <strong>Bennington Banner</strong> for staff coverage of a </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://www.benningtonbanner.com/ci_22301003/teacher-surrenders-weapon">high school teacher’s mental health crisis that ended with him surrendering his semi-automatic rifle</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>

<p><strong>Christopher Gotsill</strong> of the Bay Area News Group won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Print Front Page DFMie</a> for his April 21 cover addressing teens&#8217; views about rape.</p>
<p>The editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Taking a topic that is sensitive and making it impactful on the front-page of a daily newspaper is always a challenge. By any measure, the line between sex and assault is sometimes a fine one. Illustrating such a complicated subject is not easy, especially when teen-agers are the focus. This front-page had lots of input from the story&#8217;s reporter and editor, but it was designer Chris Gotsill who took the ideas and made a taboo subject into something that forced readers to read on.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Designer Chris Gotsill of the San Jose Mercury News wins the DFMie for best print front page for his cover on the how teens are having trouble figuring out what rape is. Chris was able to draw readers’ attention to a sensitive issue without using photography or illustrations. The typography and color was direct, dramatic and to the point. The white space around the display also allows the typography to stand out while other elements and stories of thepage didn’t compete for equal attention.  Overall, it is a memorable and high-impact page.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of four DFMies for the Bay Area News Group.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Michael-Goldberg-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Michael Alan Goldberg" /></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Michael Alan Goldberg</strong> of The Reporter in Lansdale, Pa., won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Feature/Lifestyle/Entertainment DFMie</a> for his stories about a local shelter for victims of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p>His editor’s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Michael spent months chronicling the <a href="http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/20130506/NEWS01/130509792">efforts of our area shelter &#8212; Laurel House &#8212; to combat domestic violence in our community</a>. Speaking to shelter staff and volunteers and law enforcement officials, he gave <a href="http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/20130420/NEWS01/130429997">in-depth accounts of the work</a> that goes into helping people get out of dangerous situations. He also <a href="http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/20130427/NEWS01/130429536">interviewed survivors of domestic violence</a>, sharing stories of eventual triumph and shedding light on why some people can struggle with leaving abusive relationships. We received notes from readers who said they could relate to these stories, and the shelter thanked us for giving victims a voice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Michael Alan Goldberg is the winner of this category for his richly reported and sensitively written coverage of a women&#8217;s shelter in Montgomery County, Pa. In exacting detail, Goldberg shed a light on a critically important issue that for too long has lived in the shadows — physical and emotional abuse of women by their spouses and boyfriends. In several instances in three of the articles submitted for consideration, Goldberg helped to bring abuse survivors, and those that aid them, to life, so that the readers of The Reporter might better understand this devastating problem. Goldberg should be commended not only for his reporting and writing, but for performing a vital public service.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of seven DFMies for newsrooms in Pennsylvania.</p>
