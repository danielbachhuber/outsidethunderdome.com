				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the third in a series of reports from three Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR14 through the <a title="And the #NICAR14 Digital First Represents winners are …" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/20/nicar14-digital-represents-winners-are/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents program</a>.</em></p>
<p>Late last year, a worker at York Hospital (in Pennsylvania) erroneously injected a patient with radioactive white blood cells, a pharmaceutical designed to detect infections.</p>
<p>Aside from some minor swelling, the patient showed no ill effects. The patient received the same level of radiation a person receives in a year from the natural environment.</p>
<p>Much of my <a href="http://www.ydr.com/business/ci_24891937/" target="_blank">reporting</a> for that story came from data that I pulled from U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>At the time, I was not aware of the Association of Health Care Journalists&#8217; <a href="http://www.hospitalinspections.org/" target="_blank">website</a> — a repository of hospital reviews sorted by area.</p>
<h1>Data improves health coverage</h1>
<p>During his turn at the NICAR 2014 microphone, <a href="https://twitter.com/byPeterEisler" target="_blank">Peter Eisler</a> of USA Today took those who attended the &#8220;Wading through the sea of data of hospitals, doctors, medicine and more&#8221; session on a tour of this website and that of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>Using tips passed along by Eisler, I learned that officials had uncovered a medical screening exam violation at a local hospital — data that could lead to a follow-up to my original story.</p>
<p>Both Eisler and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/dan-keating/2012/09/27/8207c022-08ca-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_page.html" target="_blank">Dan Keating</a> of The Washington Post explained ways to download the <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare" target="_blank">physician compare database.</a></p>
<p>For example, with the help of ArcView and U.S. Census data shape files, I can map doctors by their age, specialty and school in which they graduated. Taking income data, I can layer the map to show where younger/older doctors practice. Such a map could also do the same for specialities.</p>
<p>Do plastic surgeons practice in more affluent areas of the York County area? What sections of York County are home to the fewest doctors?</p>
<h1>Data improves public housing coverage</h1>
<p>Mapping, as I learned in mini boot camp at NICAR, can and should be applied to multiple topics.</p>
<p>Tim Henderson pointed out in his <a href="http://slid.es/timhenderson/section8">session</a> — &#8221;How to uncover inequity and swindlers in subsidized housing programs near you&#8221; — that maps would be the ideal way to show the disbursement of the public housing across an area.</p>
<p>After haggling with HUD for Section 8 housing data, Henderson said he was able not only to produce a map of public housing, but he also painted a clear picture of an economically distressed area.</p>
<p>He was able to use census data to gauge minority population and rental percentages to peer into the the availability of the affordable housing in a given area.</p>
<p>What Henderson found was that areas with little or no Section 8 housing and few rentals may discourage affordable housing. Also, he recommended looking at minority census tracts and mapping the affordable housing options.</p>
<h1>Data improves education coverage</h1>
<p>Full disclosure: I&#8217;m not an education writer. Sure, I&#8217;ve covered school-related stories as they&#8217;ve crossed into my beat, but my focus has never been standardized tests or the mapping of school bus routes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s going to change.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/coulterjones" target="_blank">Coulter Jones</a> of WNYC New York Public Radio pointed out some great ideas for education-related stories that I plan to report.</p>
<p>For example, during his session, Jones suggested that journalists request attendance records. This data may be used to check fire alarm/student ratios and which schools have the worst problems with attendance.</p>
<p>He urged us to request the records of school bus drivers, such as accident reports and criminal histories.</p>
<p>Another good suggestion was to overlay health inspection data with school attendance to see if students are getting sick after a failed inspection.</p>
<p><em>Why stop there? That&#8217;s just a look at how data can improve Sean&#8217;s beat coverage. Check out Chrys Wu&#8217;s compendium of <a href="http://blog.chryswu.com/2014/02/21/nicar14-slides-tutorials-links-tools/" target="_blank">slides and handouts from NICAR</a> to see how data can help upgrade your beat.  </em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The big winner this week was <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jfields" target="_blank">Jason Fields</a>. He not only provided this week’s tip and stole the show with his snarky commentary, but took home our first-ever quadruple win, being part of the two winning teams that tied for the win, both of which he also nominated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fields said, &#8220;I don’t win much, but when I do …&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Winners (tied)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/guns/index.html" target="_blank">Firearms in the Family</a></strong> put together by, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/bprieto" target="_blank">Bianca Prieto</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/dfreid" target="_blank">David Freid</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu" target="_blank">Nelson Hsu</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/cwells" target="_blank">Courtney Wells</a>, Jason Fields and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/yleow" target="_blank">Yvonne Leow</a>. Nominated by Jason Fields.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/jfk/index.html" target="_blank">Decoding the Kennedy Assassination</a></strong> put together by Courtney Wells, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/sglen" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a>, Nelson Hsu, Jason Fields, Yvonne Leow, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/dfuentes" target="_blank">Daniel Fuentes</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher" target="_blank">Tom Meagher</a>. Also nominated by Jason Fields.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Other contender</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.paradisepost.com/news/ci_25067814/this-is-how-bill-nye-science-guy-debated" target="_blank">This is how Bill Nye the Science Guy debated a creationist</a> produced by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwagner" target="_blank">Meg Wagner.</a> Nominated by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/phogan" target="_blank">Patrick Hogan</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s not about winning, it’s about beating Meg,” Fields said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Wagner beat us all in discovering <a href="http://picfont.com/" target="_blank">a new tool, Picfont</a>, which adds text to a photo.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As Wagner said the site “looks kind of sketchy, and it gives you dumb novelty font options, but I promise it gets the job done!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hogan called her work “appropriate and powerful and a fresh way to present a story that everyone else was doing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tip of the week – also from Jason Fields</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">“If a photograph can tell the story, let it.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[At NICAR, Lindsey Anderson learned that data is much more than official statistics. Here are some tips and examples to help you DIY (Do It Yourself).]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/180407759-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="(Photo by ThinkStock)" /></p><p>Before I went to the annual <a title="DFM at #NICAR14" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/live/dfm-nicar14/">NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting)</a> conference, I often thought of data as numbers gathered and distributed by officials or academics — like annual crime statistics or Census databases. If no such data existed, then I thought journalists were out of luck.</p>
<p>But NICAR taught me that data can be so much more than official statistics.</p>
<p>So here’s how to channel your inner Nellie Bly and DIY (Do It Yourself) data.</p>
<p><b>Look at the notes in your notebook. </b>That’s data. When we take notes on something, say, a privately funded educational program, we record the 5 W’s. That’s data.</p>
<p>For inspiration, check out: <a href="http://homicidewatch.org/" target="_blank">Homicide Watch D.C.</a> This site gathers data from police reports, court documents and court hearings to examine every homicide in Washington, D.C. The thorough reporting allows the creators, Laura and Chris Amico, to analyze trends by race, location and more.</p>
<p><b>Documents are full of data</b>, we just don’t see it as such. When going through piles and piles of documents, record what you find in a database and turn it into data you can analyze.</p>
<p>Check out USA Today’s <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/mass-killings/index.html" target="_blank">“Behind the Bloodshed”</a> on mass killings in the United States. The FBI records murders in which four or more people died, but USA Today found dozens of such killings (the tan circles on the chart) of which the FBI had no record. The team turned to news reports, set Google Alerts and pored over thousands of police reports from killings across the country to find a truer picture of mass killings in the U.S.</p>
<p><b>And then there’s the Internet.</b> If you can’t find data on your subject, turn to Internet chat sites, social media and more. Turn your findings into data.</p>
<p>Check out Reuters’ <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1" target="_blank">“The Child Exchange.”</a> A Reuter’s reporter was researching adoptions online and came across a Yahoo group in which parents sought new homes for children they adopted from abroad and other people were looking for such kids to bring home. The practice is entirely unregulated, so a parent can sign away a child to a stranger and that’s that. Reporter Meghan Twohey took screenshots of every post about a child and recorded all data to track their ages, genders, whether they had behavioral problems and more.</p>
<p><b>Don’t forget science.</b> <b> </b>Curious about the water quality in your town? Take your own samples and send them into a lab. If you don’t trust the official report or no one is keeping track of an issue, use science to keep track of it yourself.</p>
<h1>So how do you do a DIY data project?</h1>
<p><b>1. Plan. Plan. Plan. </b>What do you want to know? What questions will you ask the data and people? Determine your methodology.</p>
<p><b>2. Dive in. </b>You have to start sometime.</p>
<p><b>3. Keep it manageable and quantifiable. </b>You can’t look at everything.</p>
<p><b>4. Bounce ideas off a partner or editor.</b></p>
<p><b>5. Don’t recreate the wheel. </b>Verify results and findings with academics and experts.</p>
<p><strong>6. Talk to people.</strong> Data can only go so far. It&#8217;s the people that make a story.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stevebuttry">@stevebuttry</a> dumb question. We&#8217;re still expected to edit work with the same rigor we&#8217;ve used for print, right? Grammar, AP style, etc.?</p>
<p>— mikec (@delcomike) <a href="https://twitter.com/delcomike/statuses/435693446737952768">February 18, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Good question, actually. I answered in a few tweets, but said it would probably be worth a blog post. So here goes:</p>
<p>Everything has changed in newsrooms and <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://projectunbolt.com" target="_blank">Project Unbolt</a> is designed to accelerate that change in Digital First newsrooms, &#8220;unbolting&#8221; from our newspaper-factory processes and developing new processes (and standards) for a newsroom primarily focused on producing digital content.</p>
<p><strong>The editing process needs to change</strong><br />
We still want rigorous editing, but how we edit will certainly change.<br />
<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12943 alignright" alt="Project Unbolt logo" src="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo.png?w=123" width="123" height="150" />If &#8220;rigor&#8221; means multiple layers of editing, like newspapers enjoyed back in the day, I believe that won&#8217;t be returning. Newsroom staff cuts have already reduced editing ranks, and Project Unbolt isn&#8217;t going to change that. If we&#8217;re successful in growing digital revenue, we can stop the staff reductions and perhaps grow someday. But unbolting needs to happen, whatever size staff we can maintain.</p>
<p>I do expect every journalist who handles any copy, starting with the reporter, to edit rigorously. Absolutely we need to write and edit grammatically and follow <a title="AP Stylebook" href="http://www.apstylebook.com/">AP style</a> (or a local newsroom&#8217;s style) in our stories. And <a title="The Verification Handbook is now available" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/the-verification-handbook-is-now-available/" target="_blank">verify</a> our facts.</p>
<p>As I have noted before, reporters (and photojournalists who write cutlines and occasionally stories) need to <a title="Copy editing: It’s taught me a lot, but it has to change" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/05/25/copy-editing-its-taught-me-a-lot-but-it-has-to-change/" target="_blank">take responsibility for the quality of their own writing</a>.</p>
<p>Too many reporters with strong news-gathering skills were carried through the years by editors who rewrote and polished and made their writing look better than what they turned in. Well, we don&#8217;t have as many layers of editors as we used to, and the editors we have don&#8217;t have as much time to do your job for you as they used to, and sometimes you need to file live content directly without editing. Reporters should polish their writing skills and turn in clean stories. They should take a moment to read and edit quickly before tweeting or posting in a liveblog.</p>
<p>So in this sense, I think we need to <em>raise</em> our rigor: Reporters should turn in stories that are ready for publication.</p>
<p><strong>Editing in real-time</strong><br />
In <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/tips-on-liveblogging-for-journalists/" target="_blank">liveblogging</a>, blogging and use of social media, reporters and photojournalists may be posting content with no editing. That&#8217;s not going to be as clean as rigorously edited copy that gets a look from a fresh set of eyes and a professional editor before publication. That&#8217;s too bad. We need to do all of those things and requiring an editor to edit them isn&#8217;t practical. All journalists should rigorously, but quickly, edit their own tweets or updates before posting to social media.</p>
<p>But Mike&#8217;s an editor and I&#8217;m sure he was asking primarily about editors editing copy they didn&#8217;t write.</p>
<p><strong>Editors who edit copy</strong><br />
Stories that are not being covered live should be edited with rigor and swiftness. We need to be realistic about what &#8220;rigor&#8221; means today. Back when I was an assigning editor for the Des Moines Register and Kansas City Times in the 1980s, I would typically read a story three times before passing it along to the copy desk for more editing. I would read once without making many, if any, changes, just trying to understand the story and get a sense for what the reporter was saying. Then I&#8217;d edit a second time for meaning and structure, perhaps asking the reporter to clarify a few things, or clarifying them myself, and perhaps moving parts of the story around to make better sense or flow. I might do some grammar and style editing in that first or second pass, but the final pass was putting on the polish: checking grammar and style, tightening wordy or redundant phrases, <a title="Make every word count: Tips for polishing and tightening copy" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/make-every-word-count-tips-for-polishing-and-tightening-copy/" target="_blank">making every word count</a>, <a title="Strong from the start: advice for writing leads" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/strong-from-the-start-advice-for-writing-leads/" target="_blank">challenging the lead</a> to make it crisp and to the point.</p>
<p>Often on deadline, though, I needed to give a story one quick edit, where I tried to achieve all the work of those three passes I&#8217;d make through a story when I had time. I applied a lot of rigor to the story, but I applied it quickly. I don&#8217;t think many editors today have the luxury very often of three reads through a story. I think they are more likely applying the kind of rigor I used to apply on deadline.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a>, where I&#8217;m working for several weeks this month and next to help in <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">unbolting</a>, the web production team includes a copy editor, whose job is to apply rigorous editing to content we post digitally, sometimes before it goes online and sometimes quickly after it goes online in a breaking news situation.</p>
<p>In at least one respect, I expect editing to become <em>more </em>rigorous: As reporters self-edit their stories and as editors edit, both should watch for places where we should <a title="Plagiarism and Fabrication Summit: Journalists need to use links to show our work" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/plagiarism-and-fabrication-summit-journalists-need-to-use-links-to-show-our-work/">link to sources</a> and other relevant links that can add context and depth.</p>
<p><strong>Be rigorous about ethics</strong><br />
Another area where I believe editors need to be more rigorous: Occasionally (at least once a day) you should Google a unique phrase in a reporter&#8217;s story to confirm that a reporter&#8217;s work is original. I believe the vast majority — all, hopefully — of our staff members are ethical journalists who file original work. But editors should not take that for granted. If something in a story raises a suspicion, you absolutely should check a phrase — or a few phrases — to make sure the reporter isn&#8217;t stealing from other sources. And occasionally you should Google a phrase or two from the work of reporters you trust. As Ronald Reagan said in a different context, <a title="Trust but verify" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">trust but verify</a>.</p>
<p>(For more on detecting and preventing plagiarism, see the ebook <a title="Telling the Truth and Nothing But" href="http://www.rjionline.org/sites/default/files/aces_telling_the_truth_1.pdf">Telling the Truth and Nothing But</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>The crowdsourced copy desk</strong><br />
One more aspect where I hope that our editing is more rigorous: I hope we are quick to correct errors (including grammar, spelling and style errors) as the public or fellow journalists point them out. I call it the crowdsourced copy desk (I earnestly invite you to point out any errors you spot in this post or elsewhere in my work).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use that phrase flippantly to suggest that the crowd can replace copy editors. But the crowd has always complained, usually too late to do anything about the errors they caught. In my days as editor of newspapers, I probably received more complaints about seemingly small editing errors (even when we had multiple layers of rigorous editing) than I received complaints about liberal editorial positions or big mistakes. It was always too late to fix those typos in print, which didn&#8217;t merit corrections. But we can and should fix typos the public points out in our digital products (and sometimes we&#8217;ll get alerted soon enough to fix them before the story makes print). We want our editing to be rigorous enough that the crowd has nothing to complain about, but our last layer of rigor must be responding to the complaints.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also add that, while I want excellent grammar and want our content to follow AP style (unless we&#8217;ve made a choice to follow a different style on some matters), neither of those concerns ranks as high in my priorities as accuracy or clarity. I&#8217;ve taught <a title="Grammar matters" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/grammar-matters/">grammar workshops and blogged on how to use <em>who </em>and <em>whom</em></a>, and I want subjects and verbs to agree. But my priority list is too crowded to fret over a misused <em>who </em>or disagreeing pronoun and antecedent that don&#8217;t change the meaning of the story.</p>
<p>I remember plenty of examples of those types of errors that snuck past editors back in the day when we had multiple levels of assigning editors, top editors, copy editors and slots who edited copy rigorously before publication. Rigor never meant perfection, merely the pursuit of it. We don&#8217;t have as many editors as we used to, but I still want rigor from every journalist in editing what we produce, even (and especially) in self-editing your own work.</p>

<p><strong>Tip of the week</strong><br />
There are a couple things our newsroom continues to struggle with, and it&#8217;s understandable why — both involve different rules for headlines than text.</p>
<p>First, use numerals in headlines … for all numbers, not just the big ones. (<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/07/rules-break/" target="_blank">Except zero</a>. We think zero is less confusing spelled out because it won&#8217;t get confused with the letter O).</p>
<p>Secondly, drop the periods from common abbreviations like U.S., U.K., F.B.I., etc. (As in, US, UK, FBI.)</p>

<p><strong>Tip of the week </strong><br />
Want your emails to get read? Put some care into how you&#8217;re writing them. Remember that the person, or group, you&#8217;re emailing probably has a lot of email to get through. If it&#8217;s an email that you&#8217;d categorize as &#8220;come back to it when I have more time,&#8221; you&#8217;d be wise to give it a rewrite. Very rarely do we ever &#8220;come back to&#8221; emails. Here are some tips to break through the clutter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get to the point immediately.</li>
<li>Keep notes as short as possible.</li>
<li>Avoid big blocks of text</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the really important ones. Here&#8217;s a couple more good practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert links into text. It&#8217;ll make your communication cleaner and easier to read.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re responding to an email that you&#8217;re upset about, pause. Let some time pass before you respond.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are tips on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/04/effective-email-etiquette-leadership-careers-basics.html" target="_blank">effective email writing from Forbes</a> and <a href="http://thinksimplenow.com/productivity/15-tips-for-writing-effective-email/" target="_blank">a longer read</a> that I think lends some good advice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/dfmies620x4001-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmies620x400" /></p><p>In the first of a four-part series on <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/" target="_blank">December&#8217;s DFMie winners</a>, we take a closer look at the winning sports entries from across Digital First Media. The DFMie winners here include Sean Bowley of GameTimeCT.com, Scott Wolf of Los Angeles New Group and Tony Ciniglio of the Daily Breeze.</p>
<h3>Sean Bowley, GameTimeCT.com</h3>
<div id="attachment_6590" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/sean-bowley/" rel="attachment wp-att-6590"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6590" alt="Sean Patrick Bowley" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Sean-Bowley-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sean Patrick Bowley</p></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SPBowley">Sean Patrick Bowley</a></strong>, editor of <a title="GameTimeCT" href="http://www.gametimect.com/" target="_blank">GameTimeCT.com</a>, won the DFMie for the Northeast cluster by engaging high school sports fans in selection of plays of the year in high school football.</p>
<p>Bowley &#8220;used a strong combination of linking to other services, polls and user-generated content to put together his high school football <a title="CT high school plays of the year" href="http://www.gametimect.com/heres-list-gametimect-2013-ct-hs-football-plays-year/" target="_blank">plays of the year nomination post</a>,&#8221; the nomination said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project started with a <a href="http://www.gametimect.com/nominate-2013-high-school-football-plays-year/" target="_blank">call for nominations</a>, then a <a href="http://www.gametimect.com/heres-list-gametimect-2013-ct-hs-football-plays-year/" target="_blank">user vote</a>. It will culminate shortly (delayed somewhat by snowstorms) with the final plays of the year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The nomination elaborates:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The original post was simply links to the 13 segments of Plays of the Week, which we allowed the public to narrow down for the final post.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This post was the result of a season&#8217;s worth of work and innovation. What started off as a few plays in <a href="http://www.gametimect.com/high-school-footballs-week-2-players-teams-and-plays-of-the-week/" target="_blank">Week 2</a> (all staff generated, with two complementary videos taken from school websites), quickly began to grow with user-submitted videos sent to us via email and social media as you can see in<a href="http://www.gametimect.com/week-10-connecticut-high-school-football-plays-week/" target="_blank"> Week 10</a> (with 13 of 17 submitted videos).</p>
<p>Even those that didn&#8217;t have actual video could suggest a play after we discovered <a href="http://www.hudl.com/" target="_blank">hudl,</a> a service used by high school teams and players to store game film and highlight packages for both game preparation and recruiting. Many coaches were fine sharing their usernames and passwords as long as we weren&#8217;t sharing their trick plays!</p></blockquote>
<div><strong>Judges loved the project:</strong></div>
<blockquote><p>This is a great example of how a newspaper could interact with readers on the subject that you know local viewers/readers are excited about. Staff and user-generated videos, as well as descriptions of each play, offers a complete list for viewers to choose from. In this case, the videos were a key to making a successful site. Using a poll to interact with viewers is one thing, but being able to offer what they are voting for in a video took the nomination poll to a whole new level. I enjoyed seeing well-edited footage, which even had instant replays. How cool is that?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Another judge:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This seems to be to be a perfect blend of engagement and multimedia, which ended up being a fun way to relive the highlights of the season with &#8220;best of&#8221; video clips. Sean was also able to leverage a new digital game film service, hudl, to source clips suggested by readers. It was a great idea that looks like it got a lot of attention from hard-core prep football fans, extending the season and the conversation into January.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Inside Thunderdome asked Bowley for any tips for colleagues from his plays-of-the-year project:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This was the first big idea with GameTimeCT and we needed to make a statement after our launch. Originally, we crowdsourced the videos and, of course, took our own. It got a nice response from viewers, but — to me — we really didn&#8217;t get the reaction that we needed to make a true splash with the project: to get the best plays from ALL of Connecticut for that week.</p>
<p>So we had to pay attention to all the games reported, looked on Twitter to see if there were any big plays worth getting. We&#8217;d create a wish list of plays and then ask coaches or other media outlets (almost all said yes) and ripped the footage from their Hudl sites using screen recording on QuickTime, or just ripped them from YouTube using a free program. After some time, some coaches gave us inside access into their Hudl accounts so we could just grab what we wanted when we wanted.</p>
<p>The rest was just uploading into an editing platform and cutting them down.</p>
<p>The idea was to convey that GameTimeCT is here to cover the entire state of Connecticut using the prevalence of videos online. We didn&#8217;t want to just say who the top performers were, we wanted to show everybody who came to our site. I think we achieved that with the project.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Scott Wolf, Los Angeles News Group</h3>
<div id="attachment_6593" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/scott-wolf/" rel="attachment wp-att-6593"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6593" alt="Scott Wolf" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Scott-Wolf-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scott Wolf</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">December was a turbulent month for USC football with the hiring of coach Steve Sarkisian, the same-day resignation of interim coach Ed Orgeron and the Trojans&#8217; appearance in the Las Vegas Bowl. Wolf excelled all the way to win the DFMie for the Los Angeles News Group.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The nomination detailed his extensive coverage:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>When the news of Sarkisian’s hiring broke, Wolf tweeted, blogged and quickly had a story up across Los Angeles News Group websites. Staff quickly followed with photo galleries, storify reactions (players and fans), story on potential fallout at UCLA, opinion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wolf’s <a title="Inside USC" href="http://www.insidesocal.com/usc/">Inside USC</a> blog, which was constantly updated throughout a fast-moving day of news received 90,000 page views that day and nearly 1 million views for the month. He also stayed late on campus to pick up this tout of Sarkisian’s arrival:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/hemspm" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>But more impressive were some of the numbers following the coverage. One of our most-viewed pages throughout the coverage was: “<a href="http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20131202/latest-usc-tweets-from-scott-wolf-on-steve-sarkisian-ed-orgeron-and-more" target="_blank">Latest tweets from Scott Wolf</a>” which demonstrate how the day unfolded and that Scott was on top of every moment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scott also regularly allowed readers to ask questions about the coaching change and the fallout around college football &#8211; numbers were impressive each session.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since October, live chats involving Scott Wolf have totaled more than 1.7 million engagement minutes, and it’s not surprising readers come and stay, given the large personal following and depth of Wolf’s knowledge in the program. He’s able to give insights no other reporter has and has been connecting directly with the audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Judges&#8217; comments about Wolf&#8217;s work:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>As someone who covered the upheaval at Penn State and seen firsthand how rumors, intense emotions and the impact such a decision can have on a community, I was impressed with how Scott Wolf brought all his tools to the table to keep the public informed of on going changes in a 24-hour news cycle for such events. Using Tout and Twitter and opening himself up to a public engagement with fans, he covered every aspect of this story in a very thorough way. Well done!</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And another:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Scott Wolf had every square inch of a month-long story covered, timely and across multiple platforms; it was the epitome of &#8220;Digital First.&#8221; The 1 million page views his Inside USC blog garnered are astronomical to think about. The writing is crisp, clean and engaging.</p>
<p>More to the point, Wolf&#8217;s commitment to getting the story, be it in print or in a Tout, was unparalleled and such that even coach Steve Sarkisian lauded the reporter&#8217;s moxie for waiting late around campus to capture a short clip. Presumably, the reporter waited more than 45 minutes for a fleeting, 45-second moment while still juggling all the other demands that come with beat reporting.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Wolf&#8217;s advice:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>My only advice is to try to make anything new fun and find your own voice whether you are using Twitter, Tout or blogging.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Tony Ciniglio, Daily Breeze</h3>
<p>After a heated girls basketball game between crosstown rivals Leuzinger and Lawndale, Ciniglio waded into the post-game fracas with his Tout app rolling:</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/gfpia3" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Judges awarded Ciniglio the ToutBout for videos shot in the Tout app, with these comments:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I really have to hand it to the brave soul who ventured onto the basketball court in the wake of the Lawndale-Leuzinger game. The Tout perfectly illustrated the mood and the chaos the writer described in print.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Another judge:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes just writing about a heated rivalry, and the emotion that the winning and losing teams feel after the game, doesn&#8217;t do it justice. This tout captured the good, the bad, and the ugliness that exists in sports.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Ciniglio&#8217;s advice:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Covering the Leuzinger-Lawndale girls basketball game taught me to be prepared for anything. Never did I expect to see a girls basketball game with two skirmishes and five ejections. The best piece of advice I can offer from that game is to always expect the unexpected.</p>
<p>I went on the court to document a heated rivalry victory and found myself in the middle of a tense situation. Camera rolling, I was trying to take it all in without regard for my own safety or that of my equipment. My heart sank into my stomach when the Lawndale player hit the phone out of my hands and into the air, and I braced for the worst when it hit the ground. When I went to pick it up, the phone was in good shape, the camera was still rolling and it was like &#8216;oh, look what I just recorded.&#8217;</p>
<p>This time it all worked out, but I will have a tighter grip on my phone and will keep my head on a swivel after this. The expression, &#8216;Good luck is when preparation meets opportunity&#8217; certainly applies here. Always be on the lookout for a story and be ready to roll with the punches.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>About Kitchen Pop</strong><br />
The project used stop-motion animation to bring quick and delicious holiday dishes to life. video editor <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/yleow/" target="_blank">Yvonne Leow</a>, who nominated the project, noted that it was the team&#8217;s first use of stop-motion animation. It was also the first interactive completed done for Digital First Media&#8217;s food channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were bumps in the road, but the ultimate project turned out great and we received a lot of positive feedback from local (DFM) properties,&#8221; Leow said in her nomination of the project.</p>

<p><strong>Winner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.denverpost.com/politics-national/2014/01/donald-trump-is-not-running-for-president-ever/" target="_blank">Donald Trump is not running for president. Ever.</a> <em>by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/aphillips/" target="_blank">Amber Phillips</a></em><br />
The new contest rules reward people who nominate a winning piece of content, and the person responsible for creating the content. Since Amber did both, she gets double the reward!<br />
We hope more staffers will follow her lead.</p>

<p><strong>Tip of the week: Don&#8217;t forget about photo galleries</strong><br />
Because there is more to journalism than headline tips, we&#8217;ve decided to begin expanding our weekly tips to some other areas we regularly deal with. This week&#8217;s tip is relevant to story production: Use MediaCenter galleries! Thunderdome staff can select this as an option in Mission Control (our CMS), or you can use an embed code to place them into a Spundge story. Check out Denver Post&#8217;s MediaCenter at <a href="http://photos.denverpost.com/" target="_blank">http://photos.denverpost.com/</a>. If you have any questions regarding Digital First Media&#8217;s Media Center, please contact p<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/trasmussen/" target="_blank">hoto chief Tim Rasmussen</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/AP13030704840-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Feed it: In this 2013 file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses the Facebook News Feed at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)" /></p><p>Just as with Google, everything that shows in a user&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed" target="_blank">Facebook News Feed is dictated by a complex algorithm</a> that is constantly evolving. If you manage a Facebook page for your news brand, you almost certainly noticed a dramatic decline in organic page reach over the past month due to some recent tweaks to this algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>So what happened? Why is reach down?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=781079165252672&amp;set=a.123367607690501.18902.119553158071946&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a sound explanation from Ivan Lajara, life editor of the Daily Freeman.</a></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s an <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/768/News-Feed-FYI-Helping-You-Find-More-News-to-Talk-About" target="_blank">explainer from Facebook about why these changes are important</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What can we can do?</strong><br />
Ivan took this conversation to <a href="http://dailyfreeman.blogspot.com/2014/01/dfm-chat-on-facebook-page-engagement.html" target="_blank">a recent installment of #DFMChat</a>, which he hosts every Wed. at 12 p.m. ET. His intent was to capture best practices and resources that can help journalists re-think their approach to Facebook pages. So, he presented the group with <a href="https://hackpad.com/Facebook-for-newsrooms-Xep6ARhmgAz">this collaborative Hackpad document</a> designed to capture and flesh out the best points and links tweeted during the #DFMChat (and after).</p>
<h1><strong>Here it is: <a href="https://hackpad.com/Facebook-for-newsrooms-Xep6ARhmgAz" target="_blank">The Facebook for newsrooms guide<br />
</a></strong></h1>
<p>Anything to add? The Hackpad is open for collaboration, so edit in your own findings and suggested resources.</p>
<p>In something of a twist, <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/787/News-Feed-FYI-What-Happens-When-You-See-More-Updates-from-Friends" target="_blank">Facebook announced another change to the algorithm yesterday</a>, which has implications for some of the best practices laid out on the guide just a week ago. According to Chris Turitzin, FB&#8217;s News Feed product manager, posts with links and previews will now rank better for pages, while text-only posts will rank better for individual users. So it&#8217;s important that journalists managing pages keep an eye on their reach and insights and continue to experiment with what works and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Ivan, and hopefully others, will keep the Facebook for newsrooms guide up-to-date well into the foreseeable future.
