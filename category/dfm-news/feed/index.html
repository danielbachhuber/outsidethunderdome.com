		<description><![CDATA[February's DFMie-winning journalism ranges from coverage of a nuclear waste leak to an effort to identify people in old photos to exposing excessive pay of a school superintendent. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/dfmies620x4001-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmies620x400" /></p><p>February&#8217;s DFMie-winning journalism ranged from coverage of a nuclear waste leak to an effort to identify people in old photos to exposing excessive pay of a school superintendent.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a break down of the month&#8217;s winners. See below for more details on each.</p>
<h3>Watchdog journalism</h3>
<p><strong>Metro Division</strong>: <strong>Rob Kuznia</strong> of the Daily Breeze in Torrance, Calif., won the Metro DFMie for revealing that a school superintendent in a small district was making nearly double the compensation of the superintendent of the Los Angeles School District.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado/Utah Division</strong>: <strong>Erica Meltzer</strong> of the Daily Camera won the DFMie for non-metro newsrooms in Colorado and Utah for reporting on surveillance cameras watching homeless people in Boulder.</p>
<p><strong>Midwest Division</strong>: <strong>The Michigan newsrooms</strong> won the Midwest DFMie for a project on declining property values in the state.</p>
<h3>News coverage</h3>
<p><strong>Northeast Division</strong>:<strong> Andrew Amelinckx</strong> of the Berkshire Eagle won the Northeast DFMie for live coverage of a triple murder trial.</p>
<p><strong>Texas/New Mexico Division</strong>: <strong>The Carlsbad Current-Argus</strong> won the Texas/New Mexico DFMie for coverage of a fire and leak at a nuclear waste repository.</p>
<h3>Sports coverage</h3>
<p><strong>Los Angeles News Group Division</strong>: The Los Angeles News Group DFMie went to team coverage of signing day for high school football players agreeing to college scholarships.</p>
<p><strong>Bay Area News Group Division</strong>: Graphic artist <strong>Jeff Durham</strong> and sports columnist <strong>Marcus Thompson</strong> won the Bay Area News Group DFMie for their analysis of the &#8220;Picture Perfect&#8221; shot of Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry.</p>
<h3>Community Engagement</h3>
<p><strong>Northern California Division</strong>: The <strong>Vallejo Times-Herald</strong> won the Northern California DFMie for a Valentine&#8217;s engagement project.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia Division</strong>: <strong>Matt Murphy</strong> and<strong> Billy Wolfe</strong> of the Charleston Daily Mail won in the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster for a community engagement project to identify the people in the portraits found in an old photo studio.</p>
<h3>Tout Bout</h3>
<p><a href="http://wp.me/p2SLaZ-2gs" target="_blank">ToutBout winners were announced in this separate post</a>.</p>
<h3>Judging</h3>
<p>Judges for the February DFMies and ToutBout were the <a title="January DFMies: Gun-control coverage, scandals, multimedia and more" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/03/18/january-dfmies-feature-gun-control-coverage-scandals-multimedia-packages/" target="_blank">January winners</a> (including representatives from staff winners): Daniel Tedford, Daniel Aitken, Harrison Sheppard, Dana Bartholomew, John McCoy, Carolina Garcia, Miriam Vasquez, Tom Tripicco, Nathan Mayberg, Ben Garver, Dave Boucher, Matt Murphy, Marcus Costentino, Stephanie Metzger, Eric Bonzar, Sarah Kuta, Kevin Johnson, Zack Ponce, Karl Mondon, John Valenzuela, Jim Harrington, Chuck Barney, Julie Jag and Stephen Baxter.</p>
<p>Judges have no input on the judging for their own clusters. So, for instance, Murphy and Ponce were not involved in judging the winning entries that they worked on. They&#8217;re just on a roll.</p>
<p>Details on the February winners follow. We&#8217;re inviting the winners to tweet lessons from their winning projects and will update with the tweets as they post them:</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.142857143rem; line-height: 1.846153846;">Rob Kuznia dug into superintendent&#8217;s pay</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Fernandez.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8684 aligncenter" alt="Illustration for Daily Breeze superintendent story" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Fernandez.jpg" width="637" height="486" /></a>The total compensation for Centinela Valley Union High School District Superintendent Jose Fernandez was hidden in opaque contract language, but <a title="@RobKuznia" href="https://twitter.com/RobKuznia" target="_blank">Kuznia</a> decoded it with the help of a school finance expert. The resulting <a title="Daily Breeze investigation of Centinela superintendent pay" href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/centinela-valley-investigation">stories</a>, showing that the small-school district was paying its superintendent more than double the total compensation of the Los Angeles superintendent.</p>
<p>Kuznia&#8217;s reporting prompted an <a title="Centinela Valley School District emergency meeting" href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/social-affairs/20140225/live-centinela-valley-high-school-district-emergency-meeting">emergency school board meeting</a> and <a href="http://asmdc.org/members/a66/news-room/press-releases/assemblymember-muratsuchi-introduces-legislation-to-prevent-excessive-school-administrator-compensation">proposed legislation to prevent such excessive pay</a> in the future.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why we are journalists: Holding accountable this public entity that is clearly out of touch is at the very core of our profession and illustrates the value of a newspaper — or media organization — to its community.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Andrew Amelinckx liveblogged murder trial</h3>
<div id="attachment_8628" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/andrew-amelinckx/" rel="attachment wp-att-8628"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8628" alt="Andrew Amelinckx" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Andrew-Amelinckx-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Amelinckx</p></div>
<p><a title="Andrew Amelinckx" href="https://twitter.com/BE_TheAmelinckx">Andrew Amelinckx</a> of the Eagle won for his l<a title="Adam Lee Hall murder trial live coverage" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_24853252">ive coverage of the triple-murder trial of Adam Lee Hall,</a> a reputed Hells Angel. As <a href="http://www.berkshireeagleblogs.com/unbolts/2014/03/26/unbolt-1552145-engagement-minutes/">Kevin Moran, vice president for news at New England Newspapers, recounted in a blog post about the trial</a>, it drew 25,855 engagement hours from more than 53,000 unique visitors, averaging 21 minutes a visit. To get an idea of how many hours that is, Moran says, think of it as working a 40-hour week for 12 1/2 years with no vacation. Moran also blogged an <a title="Liveblogging tips" href="http://www.berkshireeagleblogs.com/unbolts/2014/04/04/unbolt-tips-for-live-blogging-a-big-trial/">interview with Amelinckx about liveblogging tips</a>.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrew gets major bonus points for his industriousness, aggressiveness and persistence, not to mention his digital-first willingness to learn a new skill (ScribbleLive). I admired the way he tirelessly filed updates throughout the trial, keeping his readers (and the community) informed.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Erica Meltzer reported on surveillance of homeless</h3>

<p>A <a title="Boulder City Council story by Erica Meltzer" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_25119409">brief exchange at a Boulder City Council meeting</a> prompted <a title="Erica Meltzer" href="https://twitter.com/meltzere">Meltzer</a> to seek public records and push for answers. Two days after the meeting, Meltzer broke the news that the c<a title="Boulder admits to downtown surveillance program" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_25136880">ity was operating surveillance cameras in downtown Boulder</a>.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gleaned by a keen ear and a public records request, the story highlights the best in watchdog journalism. It also forced city officials and police to admit to clandestine peeping and the purchase of $8,000 in surveillance equipment, sparking a local debate about civil rights.</p></blockquote>
<h3>A &#8216;Picture Perfect&#8217; winner</h3>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/ssjm0215mtcurry90online/" rel="attachment wp-att-8688"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8688" alt="Jeff Durham graphic of Stephen Curry's shot" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Curry-graphic-1024x679.jpg" width="625" height="414" /></a></p>

<p>Judges&#8217; comment:</p>
<blockquote><p> The nearly scientific analysis of his shooting technique is remarkable and unusual for sports coverage. The graphic pulled me in and the prose was thorough and took me by surprise.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Charleston photo project wins</h3>
<div id="attachment_8618" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/billy-wolfe/" rel="attachment wp-att-8618"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8618" alt="Billy Wolfe" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/BILLY-Wolfe-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Billy Wolfe</p></div>
<p>After Lindsay Hignite died in 2000, Lindsay&#8217;s Studio in East Charleston never reopened. When the Charleston Urban Renewal Authority bought the building last fall, workers found thousands of prints of portraits of Charleston people. <a title="Matt Murphy" href="https://twitter.com/DMLocalGov">Matt Murphy</a> and Billy Wolfe of the Charleston Daily Mail got to work trying to identify and match the photos with their subjects or family members, using a <a title="Charleston Daily Mail photo gallery of old portraits" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151939133851272.1073741849.17795641271&amp;type=3">Facebook photo gallery</a> that has been shared more than 200 times.</p>

<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Charleston Daily Mail used ingenuity to take what would seem like a daunting task and turned it into an impactful, digital project that touches the very core of their readers. Using Facebook as the medium, the staff created a digital database of their community&#8217;s past with these photos and, in essence, collaborated with their readers to tell this story.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Another Vallejo engagement winner</h3>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/now-thats-love/" rel="attachment wp-att-8694"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8694" alt="Vallejo Times-Herald Now That's Love logo" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Now-Thats-Love.jpg" width="200" height="182" /></a>Fresh off their <a title="Seven repeat winners in November DFMies and ToutBout awards" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/06/november-dfmies-breaking-news-enterprise-engagement-sports-storytelling/">November DFMie win</a> for their Generation Snaps engagement project, Lanz Christian Bañes and Chris Riley of the Times-Herald teamed with colleague Irma Widjojo for a Valentine&#8217;s engagement project, Now That&#8217;s Love.

<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vignettes stand on their own as show-not-tell illustrations of the greatest human (and even canine) attribute. Very lean. Very tight. Very lovingly written. And a great job at good old-fashioned storytelling.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Michigan property values project</h3>
<p>A team from all DFM newsrooms in Michigan collaborated on an analysis of falling property values, showing that the decline appears to have bottomed out in southeastern Michigan. The project included stories by <a title="Oakland Press property values story" href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20140214/falling-property-values-may-have-bottomed-out-in-most-communities">Charlie Crumm</a>, <a title="News-Herald property value story" href="http://www.thenewsherald.com/articles/2014/02/16/news/doc52fe785756c73691603524.txt">Erica McClain</a>, <a title="Ann Arbor Journal property values story" href="http://www.heritage.com/articles/2014/02/17/ann_arbor_journal/news/doc53015c8050214819082692.txt">Nichole Seguin</a> and <a title="Macomb Daily property value story" href="http://www.macombdaily.com/government-and-politics/20140214/macomb-county-posts-solid-gains-in-property-values">Norb Franz</a> and a <a title="Google Fusion map" href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col2+from+19X9CQZ3ZT_9g1So9mKG3_IaNsnwnKkuKvZnFoBk&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=42.554879708009544&amp;lng=-83.38927282421879&amp;t=1&amp;z=9&amp;l=col2&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=GEOCODABLE">Google Fusion map by McClain</a>. Others contributing to the project were by Michelle Rogers, John Turk, Lara Stump, Gina Joseph, Kevin Martin, Randi Shaffer and Lisa Jonaitis.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The story and online maps take a complex issue and break it into easily digested maps and pieces of information. The story&#8217;s format recognized the way people outside journalism consume information now — not always in written form. More data should be presented this way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Sports coverage of signing day</h3>
<div id="attachment_6593" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/scott-wolf/" rel="attachment wp-att-6593"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6593" alt="Scott Wolf" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Scott-Wolf-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scott Wolf</p></div>
<p>The Los Angeles News Group&#8217;s <a title="National signing day coverage" href="http://www.presstelegram.com/national-signing-day">coverage of signing day</a> for football players heading to college included a liveblog, photo galleries, player biographies and a constantly updated database of signings involving UCLA, USC and local areas. The coverage generated 275,000 page views. The liveblog alone had 970,000 engagement minutes. Journalists driving the coverage were USC beat writer Scott Wolf, UCLA beat writer Jack Wang, High School Sports Editor Fred Robledo and Programmer Phil Lawrence. Wolf&#8217;s USC coverage won the <a title="3 sports coverage tips from December’s DFMie winners" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/07/december-dfmies-sports/">LANG DFMie for December</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_8699" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/phil-lawrence/" rel="attachment wp-att-8699"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8699" alt="Phil Lawrence" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Lawrence-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Phil Lawrence</p></div>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was impressed by the throughness of the project. There are a lot of people throughout the country who pay close attention to college athletics, and it appears the staff was able to harness that interest for the benefit of their audience.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fire and radiation leak at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant 26 miles east of Carlsbad were the most serious incidents in the plant&#8217;s 15-year history, exposing 13 workers to radiation. The <a title="Current-Argus coverage of nuclear leak" href="http://www.currentargus.com/wipp">Current-Argus coverage</a> was led by reporter Zack Ponce with contributions from Jessica Onsurez, Jon Smith and Martha Mauritson.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>My vote is for the staff of the Carlsbad Current-Argus. I especially liked their use of Tout, Twitter and ScribbleLive to keep people updated on the story, and also their commitment to digging deeper through the use of FOIAs. These stories have my vote because the reporters are acting as watchdogs in this scenario and that&#8217;s a service to the community. Also, it&#8217;s just stellar journalism.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Julia Prodis Sulek, Bay Area News Group</h3>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/g85kk7" height="428" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Sulek of the Bay Area News Group wins the Tout Bout for her <a title="This 95-year-old vet goes viral with San Jose Mercury News video" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/05/95-year-old-vet-viral-san-jose-mercury-news-video/" target="_blank">viral video</a> of runners detouring from a race course to shake hands with a veteran cheering them on. The video, which was played on TV networks, has more than 1.4 million views.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Her Tout brought tears to my eyes, and I think represents why we do what we do as reporters. She was on the ground, amongst &#8220;the people,&#8221; capturing spontaneous moments as they happen. If she had been standing at the finish line waiting for the race to end, she would&#8217;ve missed this moment entirely.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Matt Goul, York Daily Record<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><br />
</span></h3>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/0tvxky" height="428" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The York Daily Record&#8217;s Goul wins for his GameTimePA basketball buzzer-beater video, capturing the in-bounds pass, the winning shot and the resulting celebration (one of three buzzer beaters nominated).</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The video tells a complete story with action and emotion.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Sean Hiller, Los Angeles News Group</h3>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/w25qij" height="428" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Hiller of the Los Angeles News Group wins for his &#8220;<a title="Kelp Watch 2014" href="http://www.presstelegram.com/environment-and-nature/20140306/kelp-watch-2014-cal-state-long-beach-marine-biologists-look-at-effects-of-fukushima-fallout">Kelp Watch</a>&#8221; video about marine biologists studying local effects of the damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Professional video and camera work, great editing, nice multi camera angles and great explanation by speaker.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Two errors and Tout Bout hits &#8220;pause&#8221;</h3>
<p>The selection of three winners instead of the usual selection of two Tout Bout winners in a month is a result of two errors — one by me in including with the February nominations a March video nominated by a colleague of the journalist and one by an editor who nominated a video in the wrong category.</p>
<p>After conferring with other top Digital First Media editors, we decided to recognize all three videos as Tout Bout winners, without categories. All three earned strong praise from the judges.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also going to suspend the Tout Bout contest at least for March, while editors consider whether to make changes in the awards and how to coordinate judging and announcements <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/looking-for-my-next-opportunity-whatever-that-is/" target="_blank">after my departure from the company</a>.</p>
<h3>Judges</h3>
<p>Judges for the February DFMies and Tout Bout were the January winners (including representatives from staff winners): Daniel Tedford, Daniel Aitken, Harrison Sheppard, Dana Bartholomew, John McCoy, Carolina Garcia, Miriam Vasquez, Tom Tripicco, Nathan Mayberg, Ben Garver, Dave Boucher, Matt Murphy, Marcus Costentino, Stephanie Metzger, Eric Bonzar, Sarah Kuta, Kevin Johnson, Zack Ponce, Karl Mondon, John Valenzuela, Jim Harrington, Chuck Barney, Julie Jag and Stephen Baxter.</p>

<p>Three clusters where multiple newsrooms collaborate on news coverage had similar DFMie showings: five for the Los Angeles News Group, four for the Bay Area News Group and four for the Connecticut newsrooms.</p>

Four newsrooms won a total of six staff awards. The awards will be presented to the winners at an April 23 program at the St. Paul Hotel in St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p>Winners receive $1,000 each (split if up to four journalists were nominated). For staff winners (five or more people contributing), the $1,000 prize goes towards a staff party or a community donation.</p>

Willis</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> of the Bay Area News Group won the </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/25/2014-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank">2014 Data Journalism DFMie</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> for their analysis of pay for public workers.</span></p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each year, Thomas Peele and Daniel Willis painstakingly collect compensation data from hundreds of public agencies across Northern California to expose little-known perks for government employees that leave taxpayers fuming and seasoned watchdogs scratching their heads.</p>
<p>Their enterprising approach to government reporting starts with the mammoth task of badgering more than 600 agencies for data and managing hundreds of public records requests, then building a database for all to search at <a href="http://mercurynews.com/salaries" target="_blank">www.mercurynews.com/salaries</a>. With fewer reporters covering city halls, Peele and Willis mine data to reveal the scope of ongoing government waste — a true public service.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reporters Thomas Peele and Daniel Willis of the Bay Area News Group win the DFMie for best data journalism for surfacing Northern California’s excessive perks and salary for government employees. Thomas and Daniel collected and analyzed government employee compensation from more than 600 agencies. The data yielded stories about the BART’s top-paid worker of 2012 never worked a day and part-time job at the harbor commission that paid $1,100 an hour. They also created an easy-to-use database widget to search the compensation records. Without the data work, none of these stories would of been possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stories submitted for judging included one documenting that <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23416601/barts-top-paid-worker-2012-never-worked-day">Bay Area Rapid Transit’s top-paid worker of 2012 never worked a day</a>, one about <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/salary-survey/ci_24344700/1-100-an-hour-part-time-service-at">part-time workers getting up to $1,100 an hour</a> and one on <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/salary-survey/ci_24798591/former-part-time-pols-bay-area-reap-medical">former part-time politicians getting taxpayer-funded medical benefits</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of four DFMies for the Bay Area News Group.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Santa Cruz Sentinel's surfing coverage and Sarah Kuta's reporting on sexual harassment won DFMies. Here's the story behind the stories.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/dfmies620x4001-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmies620x400" /></p><p><em>This is the fifth in a series of five <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/tag/behind-the-dfmie" target="_blank">Behind the DFMie</a> reports on<a title="Breaking news coverage dominates the January DFMies and Tout Bout" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/06/january-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank"> January’s DFMie winners</a>.</em></p>
<p>January’s DFMie winners included a repeat winner for event coverage and a strong example of watchdog reporting on a state university.</p>
<p><a title="Sarah Kuta" href="http://www.sarahkuta.com/">Sarah Kuta</a> of the Daily Camera in Boulder won the DFMie for the non-metro newsrooms in Colorado and Utah for reporting on sexual harassment in the philosophy department of the University of Colorado.</p>
<p>For the second straight year, the Santa Cruz Sentinel staff won a DFMie in the Northern California cluster for its multi-platform coverage of the <a title="Santa Cruz Sentinel Mavericks coverage" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/mavs">Mavericks Invitational big wave surfing contest</a>.</p>
<h3>Sarah Kuta&#8217;s coverage of harassment</h3>
<div style="width: 239px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1582580799/cropped_for_Twitter.jpg" width="229" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sarah Kuta, linked from Twitter avatar</p></div>
<p>The nomination, lightly edited, explains how Kuta jumped on the sexual harassment story:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Jan. 31, just days after announcing it was in compliance with Title IX legal requirements, the University of Colorado made a shocking revelation, releasing an independent report that found pervasive sexual harassment and bullying throughout the Boulder campus&#8217; philosophy department.</p>
<p>Our higher education reporter, Sarah Kuta, immediately digested the report, and began reaching out to every member of the department, as much of the report was written in generalities with no specific names or incidents revealed.</p>
<p>Sarah was able to quickly report and write a thorough <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25035043">mainbar for the web</a>, letting our readers know about the allegations and what the university plans to do about it, and she delved into the broader issues at play involving CU&#8217;s Office of Discrimination and Harassment — something she already was well-versed with because of a prior scandal in the sociology department.</p>
<p>She also produced a sidebar on the <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25039305">department&#8217;s stunned reaction to the decision by the university to make the report public</a>, and was able to write a second sidebar based on an <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25038653">interview with one of the report&#8217;s investigators</a>.</p>
<p>Sarah is relatively new to the higher-ed beat here at the Camera, but she has proven herself to be a meticulous and aggressive journalist, and her reporting of the sexual harassment allegations within CU&#8217;s philosophy department is an outstanding example of her work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges’ comments on her work:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reporter, Sarah Kuta, did an excellent job breaking down the report and reactions to it, providing boxes with key highlights for readers, and including a variety of perspectives in her stories. Each time a document was mentioned, a link was handily provided or the story indicated where it could easily be read. I also found myself intrigued by the &#8220;related stories&#8221; headlines, and just kept reading.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>In what is supposed to be the enlightened environment of a college campus — in particular CU Boulder — this no doubt came as quite the thunderbolt. Strong reporting and good reaction pieces, allowing all sides to have their say. Reporting shows someone who is clearly engaged in the campus as well as the school faculty. I also like the move to contact an investigator who talked about how common this problem can be, even on college campuses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kuta reflected on her reporting:</p>
<blockquote><p>This story really drove home that old J-school lesson about persistence. Throughout my reporting, I called, emailed, left voice mails, stopped by the department, etc., and repeated this process until I was able to form relationships with some philosophy faculty members, who were hesitant about talking to the media. But it&#8217;s our job as reporters to find and tell all sides of any story, not just one, so I felt it was important to share faculty points of view as much as possible.</p></blockquote>
<h1><span style="font-size: 1.142857143rem; line-height: 1.846153846;">Santa Cruz Sentinel surfing coverage wins again</span></h1>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-7675" alt="Santa Cruz Sentinel's coverage of the Mavericks big wave surfing competition" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Mavericks.jpg" width="303" height="325" /></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The Santa Cruz Sentinel used the <a title="@newsmojo" href="https://twitter.com/newsmojo">Bay Area News Group&#8217;s MoJo Lab van</a> as a mobile newsroom to provide coverage from the beach. DFM Regional Engagement Editor <a title="Martin Reynolds" href="https://twitter.com/reynoldspost">Martin Reynolds</a> had taken MoJo to Santa Cruz for a <a title="Northern California regional engagement workshop" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/12/07/slides-and-links-for-northern-california-engagement-workshops/">regional engagement workshop</a> in December and the Sentinel staff asked to borrow it for Mavericks.</span></p>
<p>The nomination shows the extensive planning by the Santa Cruz Sentinel to match <a title="Surfing event coverage wins DFMie for Santa Cruz Sentinel" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/santa-cruz-sentinel/dfmies-spotlight/">last year’s DFMie-winning Mavericks coverage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our coverage of the <a title="Santa Cruz Sentinel coverage of Mavericks" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/mavs">Mavericks big wave surfing contest</a>:</p>
<p>- Rather than present a never-ending list of related stories in a package, we created an archive display group and manually curated a list of top archive stories dating back to 2008.</p>
<p>- Making use of the Home Page &#8220;Hot Topics&#8221; menu, we created a Mavericks Hot Topics and linked to related content. We made liberal use of the official Mavs site to pull in additional info.</p>
<p>- Archive slide show &#8230; we have Mavs archives, so we linked to that in the Mavs Topic Bar.</p>
<p>- Scribble Live &#8230; we started a chat the day before Mavericks contest and drew (and curated) content from various sources, mostly Twitter. The day of Mavs, we auto-imported Sentinel tweets from reporters staffing the event. In addition we manually pulled in selected tweets and Instagram photos to enhance coverage.</p>
<p>- The Sentinel made use of the MoJo van as a base camp. The van provided staffers a comfortable and convenient spot to work from, allowing for easier communications.</p>
<p>- On the day of Mavs, we kept a main story in the centerpiece Home Page slot and updated it with write-thrus as warranted. We also included links in the blurb field so that viewers could jump to the story, live chat or an interesting piece on the science of big waves. That story, by the way, came out of the blue by way of a tweet from the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>- Post Mavs, we compiled photo coverage into a Mediacenter slideshow.</p>
<p>- The premier surfing website in Santa Cruz, <a href="http://www.santacruzwaves.com">Santa Cruz Waves</a>, frequently partners with the Sentinel and provides coverage to the Sentinel. We used their photographers&#8217; photos in their standing Mediacenter slideshow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges’ comments on the surfing coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Santa Cruz Sentinel nailed it with its Mavericks coverage page. The stories were well-written and showed expert knowledge about the sport. The newspaper did a great job of relying on all forms of media — from Storify to Twitter to embedding video and television clips. I loved how they curated past stories so you could revisit coverage from past years. I especially liked the photo archive. Good job, too, creating a Topic Bar that was agnostic in linking to outside sources of information. That made it easy for readers to find all the information they wanted about the contest right from the newspaper&#8217;s page. And the paper gets points, too, for crowdsourcing tweets as the contest was set and then underway. Using the MoJo van no doubt created a presence for the newspaper at the event. Great job and a model worth study from other Digital First Media newspapers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The staff utilized pretty much every platform available to create original content in the form of photos, videos and stories and also to engage their audience with live chats and running commentary. The archive links were a great way to refer back to previous coverage, allowing readers without much knowledge of the event to get more details about references to previous competitions. The stories covered every base, from actual competition to audience interviews to issues impacting the community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reporter <a title="Stephen Baxter" href="https://twitter.com/sbaxter_sc">Stephen Baxter</a> explained the coverage (and is already planning to top it next year):</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the MoJo van made it much easier for us to file stories and upload video from the event site rather than trying to find somewhere else to do it as we did in previous years. As with any event that has a live webcast, our tweets and Storify page aimed to provide information and images that the official webcast did not have. Next year we need more photos on our site earlier in the day. That&#8217;s one improvement we can make. I hope we can keep our standards high and use the van again next year.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re looking for cutting edge surfing event previews, check out this <a title="The Australian surfing coverage" href="http://specials.theaustralian.com.au/captivate/snapper-rocks/surfing-snapper-rocks.html ">site from The Australian newspaper on this month&#8217;s Quiksilver Pro Gold Coast</a>. There&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t do this for the next Coldwater Classic or Mavericks Invitational.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sports Editor <a title="Julie Jag" href="https://twitter.com/julie_jag">Julie Jag</a> discussed the coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>I agree with Stephen that having MoJo really made a significant difference in our coverage. It gave us a central place to rally and discuss ideas and kept us from running to/from multiple restaurants/coffee shops looking for a place open late enough to send from. It also helped that we had so many staff writers — who know the drill and can be relied on to follow it — contributing, from Jim Seimas and myself in sports to Stephen Baxter from the news desk to Kevin Johnson on photos and Mike Blaesser on the web. It was truly a newsroom collaboration. Special thanks goes to Blaesser, who got us thinking about our print and online plans early.</p>
<p>Another positive this year that we exploited more than last year was our relationship with the Santa Cruz Waves website.</p>
<p>I think we had some technical glitches that caused us problems: The press boat has proven less than ideal in recent years in terms of getting video or photos without other boats in the way (though Kevin somehow got the latter) and with having space for a reporter, so finding another way onto the water would really help the visuals. Otherwise, little things like better technology (my phone and backup battery died, giving us one less Twitter feed) and a better knowledge of programs like Scribble and how to make slideshows could help us make more of an impact in the future.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell from within the thick of it, but from where I stood, no other coverage of Mavericks came close to what we offered and it should be something we take pride in.</p></blockquote>

<p><script charset="utf-8" type="mce-text/javascript" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async=""></script>Digital First Media journalists in New Mexico, Massachusetts and Ohio won January DFMies for their swift responses in covering a school shooting, a fatal crash at a high school and a police officer killing a pit bull.</p>
<p><a title="Breaking news coverage dominates the January DFMies and Tout Bout" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/06/january-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank">January was a strong month for breaking news coverage</a> in DFM newsrooms. Earlier posts about winners by the <a title="How LANG “owned” coverage of Colby Fire and earthquake anniversary" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/13/breaking-news-story-win-3-awards-lang/">Los Angeles News Group</a> and <a title="Here’s how the Charleston Daily Mail went above and beyond for water crisis" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/11/breaking-news-dfmie-winners-charleston-berkshire-carlsbad-lorain/">Charleston Daily Mail</a> also featured strong breaking news coverage. This post notes three more breaking-news efforts:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Zack Ponce&#8217;s school shooting coverage</h3>
<p>On Jan. 14, a 12-year-old boy at Berrendo Middle School in Roswell pulled a gun out of his backpack and shot two classmates and a teacher. The Current-Argus sent Ponce to Roswell and quickly had a running <a title="Roswell police report shooting ..." href="http://www.currentargus.com/ci_24904915/roswell-police-report-shooting-at-berrendo-middle-school" target="_blank">liveblog</a> incorporating Twitter updates and Ponce&#8217;s <a title="Zack Ponce story on school shooting" href="http://www.currentargus.com/carlsbad-news/ci_24913053/carlsbad-current-argus">reporting</a> and <a title="Roswell shooting photo gallery" href="http://photos.currentargus.com/2014/01/14/photos-roswell-nm-school-shooting/#1">photos</a> from Roswell. <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonbowers" target="_blank">Editor Brandon Bowers</a> coordinated with <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Thunderdome editors</a> to make the live coverage available across Digital First Media sites.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Family praying for kids at mall <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RoswellShooting&amp;src=hash">#RoswellShooting</a> <a href="http://t.co/bLmeXUbBok">pic.twitter.com/bLmeXUbBok</a> — Zack Ponce (@zackponce12) <a href="https://twitter.com/zackponce12/statuses/423148760546279424">January 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Judges commented on Ponce&#8217;s work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dispatched into a traumatic and quickly evolving breaking-news story, Zack wasted no time in reaching the scene of the shooting and filing updates on the young victims and the shooter. While Zack deftly gathered details from police, educators and others on the chaotic scene, his colleagues calmly stitched together an informative and compelling real-time narrative online that surely helped comfort worried parents and a community shaken by the burst of violence. The team members’ collective performance that day, under difficult circumstances and intense deadline pressure, was a classic journalistic response to breaking news, deeply enriched by fodder from social-media tools like Tout and Twitter and incredible photos of the aftermath. Bravo to all involved!</p></blockquote>
<p>Ponce reflected on the experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Roswell Middle School shooting tested me more than any other circumstance so far in my young career. I learned how to balance the task of gathering information through interviews while remaining sensitive to the people who had to endure such a traumatic event. There were many times throughout the day when I felt uncomfortable because of the events children were describing to me, but I learned how to manage my emotions and stay composed in a high-stress environment. Whether it is asking better questions, or gaining someone&#8217;s trust, the shooting in Roswell has provided me invaluable experience that I will carry forward for the rest of my career. Of course I wish the event never happened, but since it did I am glad I was the one who was able to disseminate the information to the public.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Berkshire Eagle crash coverage</h3>

<p>The same day as the Roswell shooting, a speeding car crashed into a perimeter wall at Pittsfield High School. The driver and a passenger later died from their injuries. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The Berkshire Eagle staff responded with live tweeting, <a title="Tout from Pittsfield High School crash" href="http://www.tout.com/embed/touts/334wfp" target="_blank">Tout videos</a>, <a title="Photo gallery of Pittsfield High School crash" href="http://photos.berkshireeagle.com/2014/01/14/photos-car-crashes-into-wall-on-pittsfield-high-school-lawn/" target="_blank">still</a> <a title="Pittsfield High School crash photos" href="http://photos.berkshireeagle.com/2014/01/15/photos-phs-crash-investigation/" target="_blank">images</a> and reporting at the scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#8220;We set up our re-write desk at the newsroom and compiled the <a title="Berkshire Eagle coverage of fatal crash" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_24910155" target="_blank">initial breaking news story</a> and assembled four additional updates to the unfolding narrative from reporter tweets and from reporters calling in more extensive information from the scene,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/iamberkshire" target="_blank">Kevin Moran</a> Regional Vice President of News at New England Newspapers, wrote in his nomination.</span></p>
<p>Though the coverage didn&#8217;t start until about 3 p.m. (ET), BerkshireEagle.com set a traffic record (since broken) that day with 202,605 page views.</p>
<p>Using the hashtag #PHScrash, the Eagle staff drove strong Twitter engagement with tweets from the scene, getting dozens of retweets for several different tweets and attracting hundreds of new followers.</p>
<p>Coverage continued the next day when a <a title="Berkshire Eagle crash coverage" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_24916190" target="_blank">second person died and both people in the car were identified</a>, then another <a title="Berkshire Eagle coverage of vigil for crash victims" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/ci_24939260" target="_blank">story</a> and more <a title="Video of vigil for crash victims" href="http://www.tout.com/m/gky3g9" target="_blank">video</a> and <a title="Photos of vigil for crash victims" href="http://photos.berkshireeagle.com/2014/01/17/photosvigil-for-earnest-duck-and-tariq-salley/" target="_blank">photo</a> coverage of a vigil for the victims.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>I admire their stick-to-itiveness. The team put a face on the story rather than simply make it a spot news story and be done with it. The initial story contained a lot of detail on the crash and didn&#8217;t simply rely on police information. The immediate coverage of the event through social media was a real service to the community by quelling fears about the crash harming anyone at the school and providing valuable traffic information to motorist. The multiple photo galleries were a nice element to the comprehensive multi-day coverage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eagle staffers shared some observations and lessons from their coverage.</p>
<p>Moran:</p>
<blockquote><p>As far as social media with this local breaking news event, it was key to settle on a Twitter hashtag right away. We picked #PHScrash (PHS for Pittsfield High School) and used it with every update. (We&#8217;ve put this technique into our breaking news playbook.) That really helped the audience follow the story. Also, a staffer in the newsroom wrote the initial breaking news story off our tweets from the scene, and we updated the story numerous times off subsequent Twitter posts and a phone call or two with the reporter at the scene.</p>
<p>I kicked myself later for not having launched a <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a> liveblog on this. But as a result, we now have and continue to develop a breaking news checklist to remind ourselves in the heat of the moment about all the digital tools at our disposal — and which ones are the best ones to pick for various breaking news situations. For coverage of this kind of breaking news, we know to drop everything and deploy people to the scene and have folks in the newsroom monitoring social media, posting updates, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/szollshan" target="_blank">Stephanie Zollshan</a>, visual news journalist:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was covering the crash, I got there just a little after the victims were put into the ambulances because I was far away when the call came in and rushed to the scene. Even though video is not my specialty, having the past experience of covering spot news with video as well as pictures was a second nature response. &#8230; If I had done anything differently, I would have made another video but my gear was getting soaked in the rain and had gotten as much of the scene that the police were allowing us to get.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BE_TomTrip" target="_blank">Tom Tripicco</a>, Eagle managing editor, made the decision to tweet the news based on scanner reports. He also made the call to continue the coverage well past the breaking news event was over:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very quickly after hearing the scanner chatter — hearing there was entrapment … that one person was semiconscious and breathing — I very quickly got an understanding how bad it was. Twitter was the place for instant communication. &#8230; And I was very glad to have been involved with the decision to cover the vigil as well as we did and to make that a priority. … At least the feedback I heard from people who covered it suggested it was very much appreciated from the friends and family.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nathan Mayberg, Eagle digital journalist, was first on the scene. With police and other authorities not in a position to speak with the media minutes after the crash, he used observations, iPhone photos, witness interviews to inform:</p>
<blockquote><p>I interviewed every possible bystander at the scene and was able to get quotes from multiple witnesses. Witnesses can often be the most important people to talk to at the scene of a crash or crime.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BE_DLindsay" target="_blank">Dick Lindsay</a>, Eagle digital journalist, who worked the scene when authorities were in positions to speak with the media:</p>
<blockquote><p>Teamwork and being in the right place at right time were keys to coverage. After Nathan Mayberg initially went to the scene [Nathan, during a long lull, came back to the newsroom to add updates to the breaking news story online], I followed up by going out there and got additional eyewitness quotes. I was able to speak directly with superintendent of schools who confirmed none of the victims were city school students. Mayor Bianchi was also at scene and told media gathered in a brief, impromptu interview that one person was dead and another taken to hospital, information he was told by police at the scene.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BE_Bengarver" target="_blank">Ben Garver</a>, visual news editor:</p>
<blockquote><p>I covered the vigil at night. With some criticism of the drivers in reader comments, I was a little concerned that the event might be unfriendly toward media. Nothing could be further from the truth. The vigil pulled the community together and celebrated the two men who died in the crash. The event was full of human warmth and caring words for the two men and the people who lost them.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Morning Journal&#8217;s pit bull coverage</h3>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/t2fy4s" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Metzger and Bonzar share the Midwest DFMie for their <a title="Morning Journal coverage of killing of pit bull" href="http://www.morningjournal.com/general-news/20140114/lorain-police-shoot-pit-bull-that-attacked-6-year-old-boy-family-dog-saves-child-with-video" target="_blank">coverage of an officer&#8217;s killing of a pit bull</a> that had attacked a child.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The story shows how digital and visual journalism builds off of traditional, shoe-leather skills; it&#8217;s a typical breaking news story made exceptional by the use of video. I was particularly impressed that the reporters were on the scene quickly enough to shoot the video. It showed that they were doing all the things reporters have always done — monitoring sources, hitting the pavement, etc. — but simultaneously thinking about digital presentation. That takes quick thinking and shows that video isn&#8217;t an afterthought for this team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The video gives you a true sense of the chaos of that moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bonzar explained his coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I can give one piece of advice to fellow crime reporters, it would be &#8220;Always be listening.&#8221; Constantly having an operable scanner, even while traveling in a vehicle, helps reporters seize breaking moments like this. Along with diligent scanner monitoring, good communication with fellow reporters and a bit of good luck in regards to being in the right place at the right time helps us serve the public in an honest and fair manner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Metzger:</p>
<blockquote><p>The source of this story&#8217;s success was keeping open ears. While my colleague, Eric Bonzar, was shooting film and photo, I found myself listening to bystanders and police officers for information to find out what happened. The neighbors became an excellent source for information, considering many of them had seen the incident take place and some had even become part of it. Listening to their remarks and listening to the orders and conversations of police officers proved to be incredibly helpful. From a digital standpoint, this story certainly showed me that video can capture moments that even the best ledes can&#8217;t describe. Eric&#8217;s video showed the importance of quick thinking and reaction, which consequently gave way to an exclusive visual component to the story.</p></blockquote>

<p>Three Bay Area News Group (BANG) journalists won Digital First Media DFMie awards in January. <a title="Chuck Barney" href="https://twitter.com/chuckbarney">Chuck Barney</a> and <a title="Jim Harrington" href="https://twitter.com/jimthecritic">Jim Harrington</a> shared the BANG DFMie for their daily tips on television and music. <a title="Karl Mondon" href="https://twitter.com/karlmondon">Karl Mondon</a> won the Tout Bout for videos shot and edited outside Tout and imported into the Tout app.</p>
<h3><strong>The Tout Bout</strong></h3>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/c41zpv" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
Mondon won for a feature video about a fund drive to save some funky landmarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mondon told a complete story in 45 seconds, with great visuals, sound and use of text slides. Excellent!&#8221; said one judge.</p>
<p>Another judge added, &#8220;It is very slick and well edited, a great little story rolled into 45 seconds!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mondon explained his winning video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I shot it during the second half of that miserable Super Bowl game. I&#8217;d heard rumors that the dog heads might be making a simultaneous appearance at the nearby park. <strong>I figured, what the hell, they&#8217;d be more fun to watch than Peyton Manning&#8217;s offensive line.</strong></p>
<p>Turned out I was right.</p>
<p>The owner was a gas to interview. He&#8217;d hoped his Kickstarter campaign would save the beloved dachshunds. And it did. He got more than he asked for.</p>
<p>Manning might want to fire up a Kickstarter campaign of his own.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Barney and Harrington&#8217;s daily entertainment picks</h3>
<p>The nomination of Barney and Harrington explains their popular TV and music picks:</p>
<blockquote><p>With both our television columnist and pop music critic paying attention to upcoming shows and albums, it seemed like a natural move to have them pull together a short post each day with their picks. <a title="Chuck Barney" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/chuck-barney">Chuck</a> chooses three shows airing that night and in one paragraph each, tells readers why they should tune in. He also adds another half-dozen show titles, with times and networks, to highlight some of the other offerings. With Today’s Music Picks, <a title="Jim Harrington" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/jim-harrington">Harrington</a> gives readers something to go looking for on iTunes or Spotify. A recent example: With <a title="Today's Music" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_25114937/todays-music-picks-ultimate-robocop-playlist">‘Robocop’’ coming out, he lined up a playlist of robot songs</a>. It’s a clever way to engage readers and has proven popular — in January, they had 90,000 page views between them.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Here is what judges said about Barney and Harrington:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>I vote for Chuck Barney and Jim Harrington&#8217;s &#8220;must see/hear/experience&#8221; project. It was innovative because it shows the creative side of curation — the playlists, for example, are existing content laden with new meaning due to arrangement. I also appreciated how reader-centric it was; the project seems to be all about making it immediately clear to readers why the topics matter. That seems obvious, but clearly these writers are trying to think creatively about how to do that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>They take a simple list to inform readers and go further by integrating video and audio samples helping readers to interact with the list.</p></blockquote>
<p>H<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">arrington shared some advice:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site568/2010/0722/20100722_031128_jimharrington.jpg" width="150" height="80" /></p>
<p>Reinvent the wheel — I&#8217;ve been recommending, curating, for music fans for years. It&#8217;s mighty tempting to just keep doing what works — especially if you&#8217;ve had some degree of success with it. Every so often, though, you have to force yourself to do something different. Even if it proves to be unsuccessful. With these daily music picks columns, I have been throwing a ton of wacky stuff out there to see what works. A top-10 list of robot songs (with videos and tracks) in celebration of the opening of &#8220;Robocop&#8221; movie? OK, let&#8217;s try it. Why not?</p>
<p>Work smart &#8211; Projects don&#8217;t have to be time-consuming. I look for ways that I can increase my presence online that won&#8217;t double my work load. As ironic as it might sound — and as disheartening as it sometimes may be — some of my biggest success stories online (in terms of traffic) have been rather quick hits. <strong>Think about what you can offer the web that isn&#8217;t already being offered in abundance.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Barney&#8217;s response to winning the award:</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>I want to give credit to my editor, <a title="Ardua Harris" href="https://twitter.com/mzpronounced">Ardua Harris</a>, who really initiated all this. Ardua was always plugged into the idea of repurposing/repackaging things for the Web. I often write TV &#8220;notes&#8221; columns for print, where I cover 2-4 things. She would break out one or two items as separate stories for online with their own headline. Occasionally, I&#8217;d supplement the items with a couple of grafs. (At times, these separate items get more clicks than the main column!) I also write a weekly &#8220;Around the Remote&#8221; column of TV listings that gets picked up by several papers. She got the idea to play off that with a daily listing for online. That&#8217;s how &#8220;TV Tonight&#8221; was born. Of course, for the daily posts, we&#8217;d do more supplementing and filling out. And rather than just a straight TV Guide-like listing, I try to inject some voice and humor. Have fun with it. We also play around with headlines and keep track of which shows tend to attract more views.</p>
<p>After the initial success of TV Tonight, the music one came along. It helps that our online staff has devoted a consistent spot on the homepage for the TV and music posts. We&#8217;re training readers to look for them there. We also tweet them out and put them on our Facebook pages. Lately, I&#8217;m starting to see more of my followers re-tweeting them.</p>
<p>I echo Jim&#8217;s comments about working smart and experimenting. These and other things we do are prime examples of building some online oomph without a great deal of added sweat. And, as I mentioned, <strong>it&#8217;s very important to gauge how certain things do online</strong>. We&#8217;ve learned over time what TV shows/musicians/stars attract attention and which ones don&#8217;t. We don&#8217;t spend a lot of time hitting the ones who don&#8217;t. And consistency is a key. I mentioned the homepage spots that are reserved for them. They&#8217;re also there first thing in the morning, every day.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Los Angeles News Group (LANG) won three DFMie awards in January.</p>
<p>Breaking news coverage of the Colby Fire in Angeles National Forest won the Metro DFMie for a staff effort and a Tout Bout for <a href="https://twitter.com/RDFPhoto" target="_blank">John Valenzuela</a>. LANG&#8217;s cluster-wide DFMie was awarded for the staff&#8217;s non-traditional anniversary coverage of the devestating Northridge Earthquake.</p>
<p><strong>Here is LANG executive editor <a href="https://twitter.com/ma_anastasi" target="_blank">Michael Anastasi</a>&#8216;s nomination for the Colby Fire coverage:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>LANG deployed its full major story breaking-news mechanism in response to the Colby Fire on Jan. 16 &amp; 17. LANG&#8217;s reporters and photojournalists ensured that we <a title="LANG coverage of the Colby Fire" href="http://www.sgvtribune.com/topic/colby-fire">owned coverage</a> of the blaze <a title="LANG photos of the Colby Fire" href="http://photos.dailynews.com/2014/01/photos-colby-fire-in-angeles-national-forest-near-glendora-evacuations-ordered#1" target="_blank">visually</a>, socially and on all <a title="Video of Colby Fire coverage" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/general-news/20140116/colby-fire-video-blaze-near-glendora-burns-1700-acres" target="_blank">digital platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Driven by our first coverage, LANG had 1.14 million total page views on Jan. 16, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>19,000 PVs on maps. <a title="Colby Fire map" href="http://www.sgvtribune.com/general-news/20140116/map-colby-fire-near-glendora-evacuations-and-closures" target="_blank">A map showing the borders of the fire</a> as well as all the locations of evacuation centers, closures, etc. quickly became a centerpiece of our fire coverage and was put together very quickly after the fire started.</li>
<li>126,653 PVs on a gallery with 190 fire photos.</li>
<li>A <a title="Live coverage of the Colby Fire" href="http://www.sgvtribune.com/general-news/20140116/live-coverage-colby-fire-in-glendora" target="_blank">liveblog</a> that drew 4,702 uniques (7,692 PVs and 11.5 avg. min. on page) for 88,448 engagement minutes.</li>
<li>32,597 people who came in through Twitter or Facebook for 155,134 PVs.</li>
<li>More than 15,000 total Tout views. We embedded staff Touts in article, home page widget, and re-packaged in overall video news report wrap up at end of day.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment on the winning entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was a tremendous mobilization of multi-platform journalism during an extraordinary event.</p>
<p>The coverage was extensive, featuring both hard news items about the blaze, its suspects, and vital stories, commentary and information about its effects on the community and the community&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>The Tout videos were expertly produced with what must have been reels of digital footage from everyone in the LANG staff. They were combined with well-thought and spoken voiceovers — sometimes done on the fly — and showed a variety of harrowing scenes from all corners of the region. And every one fit precisely and wonderfully in Tout&#8217;s parameters. I was mesmerized by the variety of videos.</p>
<p>And, of course, it was all tied together by stunning, visceral photography that put you with the firefighters battling the blaze, with the displaced residents and among the community response.</p>
<p>Exceptionally well done. LANG indeed owned coverage of this catastrophic event.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge (lightly edited):</p>
<blockquote><p>My vote goes to LANG for its superb and thought-out coverage of the Colby Fire. LANG&#8217;s staff provided different and useful articles about the fire, the photographs in themselves told a story of the devastation caused by the blaze, and the countless videos produced were essential to show what was happening in the area. LANG&#8217;s work on the Colby Fire serves as a great example of what can be achieved by applying all the tools available to us.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Colby Fire coverage also included the Tout Bout winner for videos shot in the Tout app.</strong></p>
<p>John Valenzuela shot this video of the Singer Mansion after the fire:</p>

<p>A judge&#8217;s comment on Valenzuela&#8217;s video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I vote for John Valenzuela&#8217;s Touts because they speak a thousand words in terms of illustrating the devastating effects of the fire.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was an interesting look at the fire situation and the mansion which is probably well-known in the area. That damage is catastrophic! I liked how he used the pause-and-start option to grab quick snippets of different areas of the damage. That&#8217;s just the way the app should be used and he did a great job of capturing this story in 45 seconds.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Here is Anastasi&#8217;s nomination for the Northridge earthquake anniversary coverage:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The Northridge Earthquake was one of the most destructive temblors in U.S. History. It killed 57 people, destroyed or damaged some 90,000 homes and buildings – including the Los Angeles Daily News newsroom – and left thousands without water, power or roofs over their heads. Twenty years later its aftershocks are still felt in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>A team of Los Angeles News Group reporters, photographers and online staffers spent several months tracking down people whose lives were turned upside by the quake, looking at rebuilding efforts and examining whether buildings in the city are any safer today.</p>
<p>The result was a <a title="Northridge Earthquake anniversary coverage" href="http://www.dailynews.com/northridge-earthquake#" target="_blank">package</a> that included multiple stories, columns, interactive graphics, photo galleries, videos and personal recollections from readers.</p>
<p>Among the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;"><a title="Then-and-now photographs" href="http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140110/1994-northridge-earthquake-then-and-now-photo-interactive-compares-devastation-with-rebuilt-present" target="_blank">Then-and-now photographs</a> of the most heavily damaged areas. </span></li>
<li>A <a title="Babies born during the Northridge Earthquake meet for the first time" href="http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140116/babies-born-during-northridge-earthquake-meet-for-the-first-time" target="_blank">column catching up with the babies born at damaged hospitals</a> a few hours after the quake.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment on the earthquake coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Los Angeles News Group&#8217;s photo slider might be the only &#8220;fun&#8221; thing to come from the Northridge Earthquake. Compelling writing from Dana Bartholomew and Michael Anastasi (among others) takes us back to that chaotic January morning, but nothing tells the story quite like dragging the slider to reveal a gaping divide in the Golden State Freeway. A blend of well-executed traditional and digital storytelling tools set this entry apart.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The before-and-after images were striking and the interactive map was a neat tool to relay the memories people have of the earthquake. The breadth of the stories included in the package provided ample perspective from different sources, especially the column by Dennis McCarthy about the two boys born in the immediate aftermath of the quake. The coverage also included pieces about earthquake prediction and some suggestions on what to have prepared in the event of a temblor (which is a word I learned reading through the coverage). Excellent, multi-angle coverage of a supremely noteworthy historical event for their readers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what <a href="https://twitter.com/dgtedford" target="_blank">Daniel Tedford</a>, LANG&#8217;s news digital director, had to say about the earthquake project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody likes anniversary stories. That&#8217;s not completely accurate, but at times they feel more like obligation than journalism. So, when we embarked to do an anniversary story on one of the worst disasters in Southern California history, we thought about everything we have done and decided that was the problem. Anniversary stories feel stale because they have been done the same way over the years. We wanted to retell those stories in a new narrative. What came about were two things: Let people write their own stories via UGC, but pair that with geography. This allowed the stories to be personal, but it also helped show the scope of the earthquake.</p>
<p>Then we wanted to show the destruction, but it has been 20 years. Many people have forgotten, some weren&#8217;t alive or didn&#8217;t live in Los Angeles. We wanted to show the difference in the landscape from today to the aftermath of the quake. To do that, we used photo sliders that allowed a user to see an overlap of the same exact photo — one from 20 years ago and one from today. Without any text, I think this could have told the anniversary story.</p>
<p>There was a point where some maybe questioned how these photos could be interesting to readers or what kind of impact they could have. The work for this can often be labor intensive and command resources, so that can create skepticism. Before we launched a full-scale project to produce these, we did just one. This one prototype was much easier to accomplish and allowed us to show what we thought we could accomplish. It was enough to convince everyone and once they were on-board, we were able to dedicate resources to make things happen.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be best to produce something on a small scale first. Not everyone can see your vision and explanations can seem hollow at times. Once they too can visualize it, people are more willing to adopt your vision.</p></blockquote>
