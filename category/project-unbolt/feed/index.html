		<description><![CDATA[Connecticut Magazine explains how they are "unbolting" from the monthly print cycle to become a truly "digital first" operation.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/ct-w680h400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="ct-w680h400" /></p><p>In some form, <a href="http://connecticutmag.com" target="_blank">Connecticut Magazine</a> has existed for more than 100 years, and the current incarnation of the state&#8217;s &#8220;original lifestyle magazine&#8221; was launched about 40 years ago. An issue from the 70s or 80s isn’t strikingly different than this month’s glossy.</p>
<p>Based on digital momentum that came with the arrival of a verticals editor last July, coupled with a jolt of energy from <a href="http://projectunbolt.com">Project Unbolt</a>, the print magazine will undergo a dramatic transformation within the next couple of months.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-7118 alignright" alt="HtmlToImage-4 copy" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/HtmlToImage-4-copy-519x1024.jpg" width="363" height="717" /></p>
<p>Instead of showcasing stories assigned, edited and illustrated on a &#8220;bolted&#8221; monthly cycle, Connecticut Magazine’s pages will cascade repurposed versions of our best digital content, curated for the print audience through the prism of metrics and engagement.</p>
<p>From the advent of <a href="http://connecticutmag.com" target="_blank">www.connecticutmag.com</a> through last July, the status of the website had remained largely static: When a print issue was about to publish, its suite of stories would be posted online and dutifully tweeted and posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>While staff members were encouraged by <a href="http://connecticutnewsroom.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Connecticut group editor Matt DeRienzo</a> to create online-only content in between print magazines, via blogs and a news vertical called <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/Connecticut-Today/" target="_blank">Connecticut Today</a>, the effort gained little traction. Print was considered all-consuming, and the website would look the same for days, even weeks.</p>
<p>In the last eight months, in part through the addition of six new categories of content, including The Connecticut Table, Style &amp; Shopping and Health &amp; Wellness, we have transformed the site into a daily source of authoritative content about Connecticut — using social media far more vigorously than in the past to tell the world we have arrived in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.<a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/"><br />
</a><br />
Here are some of the steps along the way, and where we’re going from here:</p>
<h1><b>New Digital Journalists</b></h1>
<p>Where the magazine once had editors who focused almost exclusively on print, the staff is two new digital journalists, <a href="https://twitter.com/CTMagKate" target="_blank">Kate Hartman</a>, formerly of the <a href="http://registercitizen.com" target="_blank">Register Citizen in Torrington</a>, and Erik Ofgang, formerly a Connecticut Magazine freelancer.</p>
<p>Their recent arrival will enable us to quickly push verticals to new levels of impact, through daily stories and, finally, a series of high-impact stories apportioned across different genres of content.</p>
<p>The new staffing will also allow us to roll out more verticals.</p>
<h1><b>Engagement</b></h1>
<p>Before July 2013, <a href="https://twitter.com/connecticutmag" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/connecticutmagazine" target="_blank">Facebook posts</a> on Connecticut Magazine accounts were sporadic, and simply pointed to print content posted online. Now our Twitter feed is posting some of the fastest growth among Digital First Media properties in the Northeast — with our follower count at 13,414 and growing rapidly — and displaying vibrant daily engagement with our audience.</p>
<p>That’s happening not only because we tweet much more often (<em>seven days a week</em>), in a more conversational way and with links to more interesting content, but also because we talk to people on Twitter and Facebook, responding to comments and questions, seeking input, and saying where our digital staff is and what we’re doing.</p>
<p>When we did <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/January-2014/2014-Readers-Choice-Restaurant-Awards/index.php?cparticle=3&amp;siarticle=2" target="_blank">Best Restaurants: Readers’ Choice</a> as a digital initiative for 2014 by putting the ballot online, we also <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/The-Connecticut-Table/August-2013/Connecticuts-Best-Restaurant-The-Spread-Bernards-Goodfellas-Vote-Before-Readers-Choice-Wraps-Up/" target="_blank">engaged our audience by offering updates on voting trends</a> online and through social media. In other words, for the first time we told our audience what was happening while it was happening and while they could still get involved.</p>
<p>As another engagement effort, we created <a href="https://twitter.com/DouglasPClement/lists/connecticut-table" target="_blank">a Twitter list of restaurants and all things dining in Connecticut</a>, which we update and share regularly via social media.</p>
<p>For our <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/February-2014/40-Under-40/" target="_blank">40 Under 40</a> package on high-achieving Connecticut residents, we began “reporting” the story before it was published online in a series of tweets announcing prominent individuals who had been named to the list — and then we built a <a href="bit.ly/1jiqzvt" target="_blank">Twitter list of all the honorees</a> we could find (33 out of 40), so our audience could follow what they think, say and do.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>2014 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%2340Under40&amp;src=hash">#40Under40</a> awards coming soon.

<h1><b>Interactive</b></h1>
<p>At the end of last July, for the first time ever, <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/">www.connecticutmag.com</a> published a <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/Connecticut-Politics/July-2013/CT-Car-Tax/" target="_blank">story in the form of an interactive map</a> — showing the sometimes great disparity in tax bills on the exact same vehicle in different towns. The story was timed to the last day a Connecticut resident could pay motor vehicle taxes without also paying a penalty for being late.</p>
<p>To drive home the impact, we rolled it out in a series of tweets that contrasted the dollar amounts for the same vehicle in dissimilar municipalities, such as Waterbury and Westport.</p>
<p>The response was tremendous.</p>
<p>Last week, timed to coincide with pre-Oscars buildup, we published this story in the form of an interactive map: <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/Arts-Entertainment/February-2014/Meryl-Streep-Oscars-Stars-Other-Celebs-Live-in-Connecticut-We-Map-Them/" target="_blank">Meryl Streep, Oscars&#8217; Stars and Other Celebs in Connecticut (We Map Them)</a><i>.</i></p>
<h1><b>Making an Impact</b></h1>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Mar14-Cover-Web.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7117" alt="Mar14-Cover-Web" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Mar14-Cover-Web.jpg" width="289" height="390" /></a>Our digital transformation, and its immediacy, has positioned us to be able to make a significant impact in the state.</p>
<p>One example is the impact of our stories about <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/Health-Wellness/October-2013/Oxford-Girl-Who-Aspires-to-Be-Chef-Cant-Eat-Awaits-Transplant-as-Family-Needs-Aid/" target="_blank">Chelsea Wheeler</a>, a girl who wants to be a chef but can’t eat and needs a small bowel transplant. <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/Connecticut-Today/December-2013/CNN-Picks-Up-Story-of-Aspiring-Oxford-Chef-10-Who-Cant-Eat-and-Needs-a-Transplant/" target="_blank">Our initial digital story prompted CNN to come to Connecticut</a> to interview Chelsea (we engaged with CNN about the story on Twitter), and also prompted chefs and others to respond to the family’s need for aid.</p>
<p>We followed up the first story with an <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/Health-Wellness/October-2013/For-Oxford-Girl-Who-Wants-to-Be-a-Chef-but-Cant-Eat-a-Fundraising-Feast-Auction/" target="_blank">update about a fundraising event in February</a>, which sold out at 500 guests, and then we attended the event in preparation for a third story, whose shape has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In a series of emails and publicly at the fundraiser, the Wheeler family and its supporters attributed the overwhelming response to Chelsea’s plight ($20,000 raised at the fundraiser and some $50,000 or more raised between the initial story and the fundraiser) entirely to the work of Connecticut Magazine.</p>
<p>Sometimes our new impact is less dramatic but still beneficial. We’re producing more stories that have appeal beyond Connecticut, which means that stories like one on YouTube food reviewing sensation and <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_23686321/travel-channel-produce-youtube-sensation-best-daym-takeout" target="_blank">Travel Channel “star” Daym Patterson</a>, and another on<a href="http://www.news-herald.com/arts-and-entertainment/20140129/pizza-maestro-bruno-difabio-to-judge-on-food-networks-chopped" target="_blank"> pizza “boss” Bruno DiFabio</a>, are getting picked up by Thunderdome and published across Digital First Media websites in other states.</p>
<h1><b>Digital Strength in Numbers</b></h1>
<p>Authoritative dining and restaurant stories, especially those that create hierarchies, are the biggest source of online traffic for us. To extend that brand and grow our audience, we forged a content sharing partnership with a website called <a href="http://www.ctbites.com" target="_blank">CTbites</a>, which expertly covers the dining scene in Fairfield County. We <a href="http://www.connecticutmag.com/Blog/The-Connecticut-Table/March-2014/Graham-Elliots-Primary-Food-Drink-in-Greenwich-Outstanding-Cuisine-Says-CTbites/" target="_blank">excerpt and link to their stories</a> on places, events and trends we can’t cover ourselves, and <a href="http://www.ctbites.com/home/2013/11/10/tommy-juliano-of-community-table-the-master-of-dessert-via-c.html" target="_blank">they do the same</a>.</p>
<h1><b>Traffic</b></h1>
<p>The arrival of a verticals editor in July 2013, the launch of the new categories of content online and the ramped up engagement has led to an increase in traffic.</p>
<p>Page views for 2013 (at 2.659 million) were up 12 percent over 2012 views, while unique visitors (at 2.115 million) were up 39 percent, with those numbers reflecting the fact that it was largely one person involved in the digital push.</p>
<p>Momentum has been building since then as our potential audience understands that we’re now a daily digital operation.</p>
<p>Page views for January 2014, at 306,620, were up 29 percent over the same month a year earlier, while unique visitors were up 58 percent for January year-over-year, from 69,081 to 109,319. In a 2013-to-2012 comparison for the most recent month, February, page views were up 39 percent and unique visitors were up 76 percent.</p>
<p>One trend revealed by those metrics will be a crucial planning tool going forward: Connecticut Magazine’s branded features, such as Best Restaurants: Experts’ Picks, Rating the Towns and 40 Under 40, are such major drivers of traffic — when they publish and on an ongoing basis — that they have had something of a leveling effect on impact of daily verticals stories in quickly driving traffic.</p>
<p>The result will be a careful planning process to create more high-demand content for our audience on a more frequent basis, such as having some kind of “best” or “top 10” feature once a month, rather than a couple of times a year.</p>
<p>Achieving this will be made possible with the addition of the two digital journalists mentioned at the top.</p>
<h1><b>Arrival of Unbolted</b></h1>
<p>Unbolted is not the future for Connecticut Magazine; it’s already happening. The February issue contained a story about the aspiring chef who needs a transplant, Chelsea Wheeler; it was a revised and shortened version of the digital stories that involved very little time and no additional resources.</p>
<p>The April issue currently in production will have a dining story and a gourmet chocolates story that derive from published digital stories. The ratio will continue to recalibrate in favor of digital each month going forward.</p>
<h1><b>What’s Next</b></h1>
<p>New digital staff, more verticals, cascading live stories daily, high-impact stories, engagement, partnering, and using the best digital storytelling tools available will yield a Connecticut Magazine website that moves toward its goals better and faster, and a print magazine that takes on a new weightlessness in terms of time and resources—but a magazine that’s also more vibrant, authoritative and interesting than ever before.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A leading challenge in unbolting newsrooms is to break enterprise reporting free of the "Sunday story." This question guide can help.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="project_unbolt-logo" /></p><p dir="ltr"><em>(Editors note: The following post was originally published on <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/questions-to-help-newsrooms-unbolt-enterprise-reporting-from-the-sunday-story/" target="_blank">Steve Buttry&#8217;s blog</a>.)</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">A leading challenge in <a title="How an unbolted newsroom works" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/how-an-unbolted-newsroom-works/">unbolting newsrooms</a> will be to help enterprise reporting break free of the &#8220;Sunday story.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12943" alt="Project Unbolt logo" src="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo.png?w=123" width="123" height="150" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">For decades, most newsrooms with Sunday papers target their best enterprise for that day, when space is generous and daily news is usually light and readers are likely to spend more time with the newspaper. But Sunday is an awful day for web traffic. Our digital audience is more engaged during the work week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Digital First approach to enterprise reporting has largely been to publish our Sunday stories online Saturday or Friday (if the reporter turns them in on time and we finish the editing early enough). But our best enterprise still gets muted impact with the digital audience, publishing on the weekend or late in the work week. And the content still generally revolves around a long text story that was planned for print.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Planning for enterprise stories needs to focus on how and when we tell the story digitally. Presentation of some of that content as a Sunday print story should be an afterthought (like digital planning often tends to be now). We might not develop a single approach that we use for all enterprise stories, but through experimentation develop a handful of approaches that work for different types of enterprise stories.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As I help Digital First Media newsrooms &#8220;unbolt&#8221; from their print workflow and culture in <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">Project Unbolt</a>, I have suggested that we develop some questions to consider in planning enterprise stories. I’m not suggesting that all these questions be considered for every story (it&#8217;s quite a long list), but some of them (and most or all of the umbrella topics below) should be considered for every story.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.5em;">Crowdsourcing questions</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should we <a title="Crowdsourcing workshop for the Farmington Daily Times" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/crowdsourcing-workshop-for-the-farmington-daily-times/" target="_blank">crowdsource</a> before or after reporting (or both)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">How should we crowdsource: Social media, live chat, print, story, combo?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">What do we need from public? (Tips, information, data analysis, photos, videos, memories, experiences, community info, location-specific info, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Is crowdsourcing inappropriate for this story (investigating rumored wrongdoing, for instance, where crowdsourcing might damage a reputation before verification of facts; or crowd unlikely to know)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Does the situation in the question above mean we shouldn’t crowdsource or should it just cause us to be extra careful (or vague) in our crowdsourcing? For instance, if we’re investigating reports of sexual abuse by a coach or member of the clergy, we wouldn’t crowdsource a question such as “If you were molested by Coach (or Rev.) Badguy, please call us at …” But can we ask in another way: “We’re interested in reaching current and former members of …”? The answer may be no, but we should consider alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Would a tool such as <a title="Google Forms" href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Forms</a> or <a href="http://seeclickfix.com" target="_blank">SeeClickFix</a> help us gather information from the community?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Does crowdsourcing hurt or help us competitively (we need to be aware of where we lean &amp; be careful to consider the other possibility)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond crowdsourcing on our own branded social media accounts and staff members’ individual accounts, should we crowdsource with specific niches of the community who might have interest or knowledge in the topic, posting requests on community Facebook pages or groups, using <a title="#Twutorial guest post from Alexis Grant: A simple Twitter strategy that will dramatically grow your network" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/twutorial-guest-post-from-alexis-grant-a-simple-twitter-strategy-that-will-dramatically-grow-your-network/">@ mentions</a>, <a title="Hashtags help journalists find relevant tweets and reach more people" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/hashtags-help-journalists-find-relevant-tweets-and-reach-more-people/">hashtags</a> or direct messages to reach out to specific Twitter accounts, etc.?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">How should you use photos to promote the story on social media?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social media questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Are people talking about this issue on social media? If so, should we curate the social content and/or look for sources in social media?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should we embed tweets, Facebook posts, YouTube or Tout videos or other social content into the main story and/or curate for a sidebar?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should the story include a Tout widget and/or hashtag?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should the story include a hashtag for Twitter or Instagram?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">How should we use social media in crowdsourding?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should the story involve creation of any larger social media presence than simple updates, such as a <a title="ProPublica and Facebook ..." href="https://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2012/12/propublica-and-facebook-tool-journalists">Facebook page</a>, <a title="Pinterest" href="http://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest board</a>, <a title="Newspeg" href="http://www.newspeg.com/">Pegboard</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account, <a href="http://rebelmouse.com" target="_blank">RebelMouse</a> page, <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel, <a href="http://tout.com" target="_blank">Tout</a> account, etc.?</p>
</li>
<li>Should the story have its own Facebook page or group, as the New Haven Register did for its reporting on <a title="Missing in CT Facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/MissingInCT">missing persons</a> or as <a title="Join ProPublica's Patient Harm community" href="http://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/item/join-propublicas-patient-harm-community">ProPublica did</a> for <a title="Patient Harm Facebook group" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/patientharm/">patients harmed by doctors</a>?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storytelling tool questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">What is/are the best tool(s) for telling this story?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Are multiple locations important to the story? If so, do we need to use a mapping tool such as <a title="Google Maps" href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview">Google Maps</a> or <a title="Crowdmap" href="https://crowdmap.com/welcome">Crowdmap</a> to tell this story?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Do we want to use a collaboration tool such as <a title="Spundge" href="https://www.spundge.com/">Spundge</a> or <a href="https://hackpad.com/" target="_blank">Hackpad</a> for this story?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Will the story use information curated from digital sources? If so, should we use a tool such as Spundge, <a title="RebelMouse" href="https://www.rebelmouse.com/">RebelMouse</a>, <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a> or <a title="Storify" href="http://storify.com/">Storify</a> for curation and/or publication?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should we use <a title="ScribbleLive" href="http://scribblelive.com">ScribbleLive</a> in this story (an enterprise story can be related to an event, or we could use for a live chat).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Does the story unfold over time in a way that makes us want to use a timeline tool such as <a title="Dipity" href="http://dipity.com/">Dipity</a> or <a title="Timeline JS" href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">Timeline JS</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Would a tool such as <a title="Google Forms" href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809?hl=en">Google Forms</a> help us gather information from the community?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Does the story have multiple types of elements that we can integrate into a single story using a tool such as <a title="Scrollkit" href="http://www.scrollkit.com/">Scroll Kit</a>, <a title="NewHive" href="http://newhive.com/">NewHive</a>, <a title="Thinglink" href="http://www.thinglink.com/">Thinglink</a>, <a title="Prezi" href="https://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> or <a title="Intersect" href="https://intersect.com/">Intersect</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Would a quiz help in telling this story? (Remember that the <a title="The New York Times' most popular story of 2013 was not an article" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/-em-the-new-york-times-em-most-popular-story-of-2013-was-not-an-article/283167/">most-read New York Times story of 2013 was a quiz</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Do we want to request help from <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/" target="_blank">Thunderdome</a> for storytelling tools such as motion graphics?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Writing questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should this story package include a text story?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Is this a narrative opportunity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should this story include (or be) a <a title="Listicle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle">listicle</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should this story be written in chunks, with the chunks of text integrated in some form with other elements?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should this story be in quiz form?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should this be a serial?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Is a traditional newspaper-style string-of-paragraphs story the best way to tell the text part of this story, or should you take a different approach, perhaps &#8220;<a title="At Circa, it's not about 'chunkifying,' but adding structure" href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/237862/circa-not-chunk-y-fying-news-but-rather-adding-structure/">chunkifying</a>&#8221; it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linking/embedding issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Before reporting:</strong> Reporters should remember (and editors should remind reporters) to collect the links they use in their reporting and use them in the story to provide <a title="4 reasons why linking is good journalism; 2 reasons why linking is good business" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/4-reasons-why-linking-is-good-journalism-2-reasons-why-linking-is-good-business/">attribution, depth and context</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Before and while writing:</strong> Reporters should remember (and editors should remind reporters) to add links as they write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>In editing:</strong> Check links to be sure they work (and that the cited material is still there). Watch for facts where attribution could be strengthened with links or where links could provide added depth or context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Did the reporter use source documents that can be embedded in the story using <a title="DocumentCloud" href="http://www.documentcloud.org/home">DocumentCloud</a>, <a title="Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a> or <a href="http://http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">If social media posts are cited, should they be embedded?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Have we looked for related <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> clips to embed?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Publication-timing questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Is this a one-day story? If so, what’s the best day to run it (independent of our print preference for Sunday publication of enterprise stories)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">If we uncover something newsy in the course of working an enterprise story, should we publish it immediately as a news story, rather than wait to finish the full project? If so, how can we use publication of the news story as a crowdsourcing opportunity to advance the larger project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Is this a multiple-day story. If so, when should it start? When should it end?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">What’s the news peg? Should that dictate the time of publication?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Do we want to extend the story with a live chat following the publication of our reporting? Do we involve sources? Just the journalists involved?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Do we need a RebelMouse page or another tool to curate related pieces of the project as it unfolds over time?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Print publication questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Does the story include a text story, photo(s) and/or graphic(s) that will work in print? If not, should it not be a print story at all, or do we need to adapt part of the content to print?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should the Sunday story be a week-in-review wrap-up of a digital series that ran all week?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should some aspect of the story (perhaps something that works best in print) be held back to give the Sunday story something fresh or exclusive? (Don&#8217;t use this question as a slippery slope to slide back into Sunday-story thinking.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Since Sunday is the best day for print enterprise stories, but digital enterprise stories should publish during the week, how should the print version reflect the earlier digital publication? Should the digital version promote the Sunday story in any fashion, especially if the Sunday story includes something that’s not in the digital version?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should we follow publication of the Sunday story (and previous week’s digital story/ies) with a live chat on Monday or some live event during the following week, such as a town meeting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Does the package warrant a special print section? (I can&#8217;t imagine many enterprise packages where the answer would be yes, but it should be a consideration.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secrecy/confidentiality/transparency issues</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We want to be more transparent and engaging with the community in our reporting of enterprise stories. But we still should consider some factors that might lead us to secrecy or caution in enterprise reporting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Is this story likely to be competitive? If so, we don’t necessarily back away from transparency, but we might consider how to use crowdsourcing and/or incremental reporting to get ahead on a story, to beat the competition and mark a story as ours. Sometimes we might have a valid concern about alerting the competition through transparency, but be aware of most journalists&#8217; default setting of favoring secrecy here. Transparency is usually better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">How firm is our information? If we are seeking verification of information from the crowd, we want to avoid spreading misinformation. Editors should be involved in crafting crowdsourcing inquiries, so we are confident that we are seeking information without reporting what we haven’t yet confirmed. Or, if we think specific information should be shared with the public, we should be specific and clear in what we know (and how we know it) and what we don’t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Would partial information damage a reputation? When we are working on potentially defamatory stories, we need to proceed with caution and not report names or allegations in partial stories or crowdsourcing requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Would transparency spook sources? If crowdsourcing requests or partial reporting might be likely to scare potentially helpful sources from working with us, we should consider making personal contact with them before going public in any way. Similarly, if crowdsourcing requests or partial reporting might be likely to prompt powerful sources to close down access to data or less powerful sources, we should consider being more cautious.</p>
</li>
<li>If transparency would skew results of our reporting, we might want to consider waiting. For instance, if you&#8217;re going to make public records requests of local government agencies, blogging about it in advance might prompt them to be more helpful than they normally are to a citizen requesting a public record.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If we’re dealing with confidential sources, how do we protect their confidentiality? Would employer access to work computers or phone records compromise a promise of confidentiality. Would police access to work or personal computers or phone records or social media conversations (ours or the source’s) expose a relationship we thought was confidential or expose the actual content of our conversations? Do we need to take secrecy measures such as <a title="How journalists can encrypt their email" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/234005/how-journalists-can-encrypt-their-email/">email encryption</a> or <a title="Prepaid mobile phone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepaid_mobile_phone">burner cellphones</a> to protect confidentiality?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Digital presentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should this story have a portal page to all coverage (probably most important if it’s a continuing story)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should we curate all elements and continuing coverage in a RebelMouse page (perhaps the format for the portal page)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Should the portal page have an easy-to-remember URL within the branded domain (nhregister.com/CTSunshine, for a Sunshine Week project in Connecticut, for example) or even have its own URL such as CTSunshine.com, (possibly redirecting to a portal page on the domain).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Can we alter the basic design of the article or section-front page for the portal page to present the project most effectively?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">If our design and/or CMS limits display in ways that would hinder presentation of this project, should we plan a WordPress blog for presentation of the portal page and/or the whole project or parts of it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p dir="ltr">These questions might not necessarily apply to individual stories but more broadly to enterprise stories and how we measure their success and impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Are page views and/or uniques the best way to measure the success of an enterprise story?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">What are the most appropriate measures for the effectiveness of an enterprise story: comments, engagement minutes, anything else?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">What is the social-media engagement with the story (shares, likes, tweets, RTs, pins, +1s)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Where does the story rank in relevant Google searches?</p>
</li>
<li>Are there ways to measure (and record) impact beyond the digital contact with the story on our site: Responses to sources, if the story included opportunities to volunteer, donate, request help, etc.; policies or practices changed; arrests, indictments, resignations, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are other questions (or whole categories of questions) we should consider? How are you answering these questions? Please feel welcome to share links that you regard as excellent examples of digital enterprise journalism and explain how you addressed some of these issues.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll share some case studies as my DFM colleagues work on unbolting from the Sunday story.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stevebuttry">@stevebuttry</a> dumb question. We&#8217;re still expected to edit work with the same rigor we&#8217;ve used for print, right? Grammar, AP style, etc.?</p>
<p>— mikec (@delcomike) <a href="https://twitter.com/delcomike/statuses/435693446737952768">February 18, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Good question, actually. I answered in a few tweets, but said it would probably be worth a blog post. So here goes:</p>
<p>Everything has changed in newsrooms and <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://projectunbolt.com" target="_blank">Project Unbolt</a> is designed to accelerate that change in Digital First newsrooms, &#8220;unbolting&#8221; from our newspaper-factory processes and developing new processes (and standards) for a newsroom primarily focused on producing digital content.</p>
<p><strong>The editing process needs to change</strong><br />
We still want rigorous editing, but how we edit will certainly change.<br />
<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12943 alignright" alt="Project Unbolt logo" src="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo.png?w=123" width="123" height="150" />If &#8220;rigor&#8221; means multiple layers of editing, like newspapers enjoyed back in the day, I believe that won&#8217;t be returning. Newsroom staff cuts have already reduced editing ranks, and Project Unbolt isn&#8217;t going to change that. If we&#8217;re successful in growing digital revenue, we can stop the staff reductions and perhaps grow someday. But unbolting needs to happen, whatever size staff we can maintain.</p>
<p>I do expect every journalist who handles any copy, starting with the reporter, to edit rigorously. Absolutely we need to write and edit grammatically and follow <a title="AP Stylebook" href="http://www.apstylebook.com/">AP style</a> (or a local newsroom&#8217;s style) in our stories. And <a title="The Verification Handbook is now available" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/the-verification-handbook-is-now-available/" target="_blank">verify</a> our facts.</p>
<p>As I have noted before, reporters (and photojournalists who write cutlines and occasionally stories) need to <a title="Copy editing: It’s taught me a lot, but it has to change" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/05/25/copy-editing-its-taught-me-a-lot-but-it-has-to-change/" target="_blank">take responsibility for the quality of their own writing</a>.</p>
<p>Too many reporters with strong news-gathering skills were carried through the years by editors who rewrote and polished and made their writing look better than what they turned in. Well, we don&#8217;t have as many layers of editors as we used to, and the editors we have don&#8217;t have as much time to do your job for you as they used to, and sometimes you need to file live content directly without editing. Reporters should polish their writing skills and turn in clean stories. They should take a moment to read and edit quickly before tweeting or posting in a liveblog.</p>
<p>So in this sense, I think we need to <em>raise</em> our rigor: Reporters should turn in stories that are ready for publication.</p>
<p><strong>Editing in real-time</strong><br />
In <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/tips-on-liveblogging-for-journalists/" target="_blank">liveblogging</a>, blogging and use of social media, reporters and photojournalists may be posting content with no editing. That&#8217;s not going to be as clean as rigorously edited copy that gets a look from a fresh set of eyes and a professional editor before publication. That&#8217;s too bad. We need to do all of those things and requiring an editor to edit them isn&#8217;t practical. All journalists should rigorously, but quickly, edit their own tweets or updates before posting to social media.</p>
<p>But Mike&#8217;s an editor and I&#8217;m sure he was asking primarily about editors editing copy they didn&#8217;t write.</p>
<p><strong>Editors who edit copy</strong><br />
Stories that are not being covered live should be edited with rigor and swiftness. We need to be realistic about what &#8220;rigor&#8221; means today. Back when I was an assigning editor for the Des Moines Register and Kansas City Times in the 1980s, I would typically read a story three times before passing it along to the copy desk for more editing. I would read once without making many, if any, changes, just trying to understand the story and get a sense for what the reporter was saying. Then I&#8217;d edit a second time for meaning and structure, perhaps asking the reporter to clarify a few things, or clarifying them myself, and perhaps moving parts of the story around to make better sense or flow. I might do some grammar and style editing in that first or second pass, but the final pass was putting on the polish: checking grammar and style, tightening wordy or redundant phrases, <a title="Make every word count: Tips for polishing and tightening copy" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/make-every-word-count-tips-for-polishing-and-tightening-copy/" target="_blank">making every word count</a>, <a title="Strong from the start: advice for writing leads" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/strong-from-the-start-advice-for-writing-leads/" target="_blank">challenging the lead</a> to make it crisp and to the point.</p>
<p>Often on deadline, though, I needed to give a story one quick edit, where I tried to achieve all the work of those three passes I&#8217;d make through a story when I had time. I applied a lot of rigor to the story, but I applied it quickly. I don&#8217;t think many editors today have the luxury very often of three reads through a story. I think they are more likely applying the kind of rigor I used to apply on deadline.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a>, where I&#8217;m working for several weeks this month and next to help in <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">unbolting</a>, the web production team includes a copy editor, whose job is to apply rigorous editing to content we post digitally, sometimes before it goes online and sometimes quickly after it goes online in a breaking news situation.</p>
<p>In at least one respect, I expect editing to become <em>more </em>rigorous: As reporters self-edit their stories and as editors edit, both should watch for places where we should <a title="Plagiarism and Fabrication Summit: Journalists need to use links to show our work" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/plagiarism-and-fabrication-summit-journalists-need-to-use-links-to-show-our-work/">link to sources</a> and other relevant links that can add context and depth.</p>
<p><strong>Be rigorous about ethics</strong><br />
Another area where I believe editors need to be more rigorous: Occasionally (at least once a day) you should Google a unique phrase in a reporter&#8217;s story to confirm that a reporter&#8217;s work is original. I believe the vast majority — all, hopefully — of our staff members are ethical journalists who file original work. But editors should not take that for granted. If something in a story raises a suspicion, you absolutely should check a phrase — or a few phrases — to make sure the reporter isn&#8217;t stealing from other sources. And occasionally you should Google a phrase or two from the work of reporters you trust. As Ronald Reagan said in a different context, <a title="Trust but verify" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">trust but verify</a>.</p>
<p>(For more on detecting and preventing plagiarism, see the ebook <a title="Telling the Truth and Nothing But" href="http://www.rjionline.org/sites/default/files/aces_telling_the_truth_1.pdf">Telling the Truth and Nothing But</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>The crowdsourced copy desk</strong><br />
One more aspect where I hope that our editing is more rigorous: I hope we are quick to correct errors (including grammar, spelling and style errors) as the public or fellow journalists point them out. I call it the crowdsourced copy desk (I earnestly invite you to point out any errors you spot in this post or elsewhere in my work).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use that phrase flippantly to suggest that the crowd can replace copy editors. But the crowd has always complained, usually too late to do anything about the errors they caught. In my days as editor of newspapers, I probably received more complaints about seemingly small editing errors (even when we had multiple layers of rigorous editing) than I received complaints about liberal editorial positions or big mistakes. It was always too late to fix those typos in print, which didn&#8217;t merit corrections. But we can and should fix typos the public points out in our digital products (and sometimes we&#8217;ll get alerted soon enough to fix them before the story makes print). We want our editing to be rigorous enough that the crowd has nothing to complain about, but our last layer of rigor must be responding to the complaints.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also add that, while I want excellent grammar and want our content to follow AP style (unless we&#8217;ve made a choice to follow a different style on some matters), neither of those concerns ranks as high in my priorities as accuracy or clarity. I&#8217;ve taught <a title="Grammar matters" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/grammar-matters/">grammar workshops and blogged on how to use <em>who </em>and <em>whom</em></a>, and I want subjects and verbs to agree. But my priority list is too crowded to fret over a misused <em>who </em>or disagreeing pronoun and antecedent that don&#8217;t change the meaning of the story.</p>
<p>I remember plenty of examples of those types of errors that snuck past editors back in the day when we had multiple levels of assigning editors, top editors, copy editors and slots who edited copy rigorously before publication. Rigor never meant perfection, merely the pursuit of it. We don&#8217;t have as many editors as we used to, but I still want rigor from every journalist in editing what we produce, even (and especially) in self-editing your own work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/nancy-march-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Nancy March, editor of the Pottstown Mecury." /></p><p>The point of <a title="Project Unbolt: Wrenching newsrooms free from print workflow, culture" href="www.projectunbolt.com" target="_blank">Project Unbolt</a> is not to wrench the four pilot newsrooms free from print culture and workflow. We want to unbolt all our newsrooms from print.</p>
<p>We decided to concentrate our attention initially <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">on the four pilot newsrooms</a>: New Haven Register, Berkshire Eagle, El Paso Times and the News-Herald in Willoughby, Ohio.</p>
<p>I was planning some specific steps to encourage other newsrooms to start their work in the next few weeks, but was delighted by an email yesterday from Nancy March, editor of <a href="http://pottsmerc.com" target="_blank">The Mercury</a> in Pottstown, Pa. She is already hard at work leading the Merc staff in unbolting.</p>
<div id="attachment_11611" style="width: 266px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/nancy-march.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11611" alt="Nancy March" src="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/nancy-march.jpeg" width="256" height="256" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nancy March</p></div>
<p>Nancy is cluster editor for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia, and she got a preview of plans for Project Unbolt last month at a meeting of Digital First Media senior editors in Pennsylvania. She didn&#8217;t wait for my <a title="How an unbolted newsroom works" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/how-an-unbolted-newsroom-works/">blog posts announcing Project Unbolt</a> to get her staff working on freeing their thinking and working from the newspaper factory.</p>
<p>Humbling as it might be, I can&#8217;t think of anything better for DFM than for the Merc (and several other newsrooms) to unbolt as swiftly as the newsrooms I&#8217;m working directly with. Or faster. We need a dozen Project Unbolt guerrilla pilot projects, unbolting by their own creativity, rather than waiting for me to share lessons from the formal pilot newsrooms. Or two dozen. Or more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Nancy&#8217;s email, with a few comments interspersed from me and links inserted by me:</p>
<blockquote><p>The discussion at our editors meeting inspired me to have one-on-one meetings with every staffer here in Pottstown. Now, that may seem like a no-brainer that every good editor should do every year, but we both know it slips between the cracks.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buttry comment: </strong>Yes, it does too often slip between the cracks, but every editor should be talking individually (at length, not just in passing in the daily flow of work) with every staff member at least once a year, except perhaps in the largest newsrooms. I hope every DFM editor takes Project Unbolt as an opportunity for the kind of individual discussions Nancy is having with her staff.</p>
<blockquote><p>The interviews were geared toward &#8220;three things you can do to unbolt&#8221; in the next six months, or three goals to be more digitally oriented.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buttry: </strong>Again, a great move by Nancy. You can overwhelm staff if you give them too much change to undertake at once. Give people specific goals to work on right now. I would even encourage shorter timetables than six months, though (depending on the goal): Maybe three things to work on in the next three months, or here&#8217;s something to work on in February, then start working on this one in March.</p>
<blockquote><p>We had great discussions, and it then created a new vocabulary in our newsroom.</p>
<p>If I start a conversation with a reporter about the progress of a story for print, they tell me I&#8217;m bolted with a definite &#8220;You&#8217;re busted!&#8221; attitude. We describe certain people as having too much &#8220;bolt-itude&#8221; and practices as &#8220;bolting&#8221; or &#8220;unbolting.&#8221; When they tell me what they &#8220;have working daily,&#8221; I correct them and say I want to know &#8220;what&#8217;s happening right now,&#8221; because we are a live news operation.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buttry: </strong>A contrived name like Project Unbolt has buzzword potential, and you want culture change to move beyond buzzwords to action. But language is part of culture and changing a newsroom&#8217;s culture includes changing the language. I love that Merc staffers are talking about <em>boltitude. </em></p>
<p>I also love Nancy&#8217;s emphasis on &#8220;what&#8217;s happening now.&#8221; Thinking about our responsibility to be timely <em>right now</em> is a critical part of unbolting. I&#8217;d rather focus on culture change than on rebranding our core products, but if I could wave a magic wand and change our brand names (without all that rebranding work), I&#8217;d wipe print-cycle words such as <em>daily, morning </em>and <em>evening </em>out of the names of all of our products that still use them. That might be worth undertaking sometime at the brand level, but I&#8217;m delighted to see Nancy challenging <em>daily </em>thinking and talking at the newsroom level (and glad the Merc doesn&#8217;t have <em>daily </em>in its name).</p>
<p>Even as the leader of Project Unbolt, I find myself sometimes referring to one of our local news organizations as a &#8220;paper&#8221; or a &#8220;newspaper.&#8221; I am working hard on shifting that to &#8220;newsroom&#8221; if I&#8217;m talking about the journalists or &#8220;news organization&#8221; if my reference encompasses the products and/or the sales staff or other parts of the operation.</p>
<p>One more important part of that passage in Nancy&#8217;s note: Her staff&#8217;s willingness to &#8220;bust&#8221; her for her occasional lapses, and her acceptance of being busted. Leaders are making a difficult change, too, and a leader with the humility to laugh when staff members catch a slip-up is going to be more effective in leading the change.</p>
<blockquote><p>This played out nicely last week during storm coverage when instead of planning end-coverage, we started with a discussion of how to best frame our live chat, how to best display coverage on mobile, how to best engage in social media — and then how we could adjust it as the day went on and as audience had changing needs for information based on their location and the progress of the storm. (First advance word on closings, then current traffic reports and forecasts, then shoveling tips, then photos of folks shoveling, then snow heroes, then impact on town budgets).</p>
<p>Beyond Pottstown, we&#8217;re working to unbolt as a group, too. We are creating a Pa.-wide team to tackle an education project that will have unbolted ongoing interests — not a once-and-done story but an ongoing, data-driven look at a trend like charter school reform or Common Core standards.</p>
<p>Next week, I have changed the monthly Pa. editors call to an in-person meeting led by me and <a title="Jim McClure" href="https://twitter.com/jamesmcclure">Jim McClure</a> to present some of your unbolting project points. Jim emailed out the survey today to editors to get the momentum started.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buttry: </strong>I&#8217;ve developed a newsroom assessment form to help editors rate how close they are to the ideals of an unbolted newsroom. I used the form to start work with the four pilot newsrooms, and Jim, DFM&#8217;s East Regional Editor and editor of the York Daily Record<em>, </em>asked me if he could share the assessment with editors in his region. We&#8217;ll be asking all DFM editors to use the form to assess their newsrooms (and then start to work on raising scores) sometime in the next few weeks. But if you&#8217;d like to get your newsroom started, let me know and I&#8217;ll give you early access to the form.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ydr-twitter.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-13110" alt="ydr-twitter" src="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ydr-twitter.jpg" width="140" height="140" /></a>(By the way, the York Daily Record has deftly handled that <em>daily </em>issue by doing its digital branding around the initials that are its digital address: <em>YDR. </em>The D stands for <em>daily, </em>but that print word doesn&#8217;t stand out in the digital branding.)</p>
<p><strong>Back to Nancy:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The phrase and the meaning behind it has kicked our digital reporting process up a notch. I&#8217;ll let you know some of our successes as we go forward. For now, just picture Evan branding me with a definite &#8220;You&#8217;re bolted!&#8221; when I mention &#8220;the paper,&#8221; and you&#8217;ve got the idea.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buttry: </strong>Every newsroom needs an <a title="Evan Brandt" href="http://evan-brandt.blogspot.com/">Evan Brandt</a>, an outstanding veteran reporter who&#8217;s a skeptic but not a <a title="Dear Newsroom Curmudgeon …" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/dear-newsroom-curmudgeon/">curmudgeon</a>. Evan is a <a title="Inaugural winners ..." href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2012/11/29/inaugural-winners-dfmies-editorial-awards/">monthly DFMie winner</a> and was a finalist for annual DFMies last year for <a title="Staff blogger DFMie" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/lowell-sun/robert-mills-wins-dfmie-top-staff-blogger/">staff blogger</a> and mid-sized daily <a title="Journalist of the Year" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/pasadena-star-news/brian-charles-named-journalist-year-dfm-mid-sized-dailies/">Journalist of the Year</a>. He&#8217;s a union shop steward who&#8217;s not shy about challenging any BS ideas that come from on high. But if you show Evan how an idea will help us do better journalism, you have an enthusiastic leader in change. Someone who won&#8217;t be shy about telling the editor: &#8220;You&#8217;re bolted!&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[An important challenge in changing Digital First Media newsrooms through Project Unbolt will be using the right metrics to measure success. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="project_unbolt-logo" /></p><p>One of our most important challenges in changing Digital First newsrooms will be measuring success. As I explained last month, <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">Project Unbolt</a> involves changing the culture and workflow of our company&#8217;s newsrooms.</p>
<p>But how do we measure our progress? How do we know when we&#8217;re succeeding? I&#8217;ve asked the editors of our pilot newsrooms to consider these questions as they assess their newsrooms against the <a title="This is how an unbolted newsroom works" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/30/unbolted-newsroom-works/">characteristics I&#8217;ve described of an unbolted newsroom</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, we will be able to chart our progress using detailed metrics that are already available to us. In other cases, we might need to measure ourselves in some way (and decide whether the time and effort of measuring are worth the insight we gain). In some respects, numerical measurement will be difficult, but we can describe how we operate now and how we&#8217;ve changed at some point down the road. Project Unbolt will probably require all of these ways of measuring, and more.</p>
<p>I started the measurement process by asking the pilot editors to rate their newsrooms on a scale of 1 to 5 in relation to the 40-plus characteristics of an unbolted newsroom. Of course, that&#8217;s a subjective rating, but it puts all the characteristics on the same scale.</p>
<p>The scores aren&#8217;t useful for comparing one newsroom to another, because we can&#8217;t tell whether a low score reflects a newsroom with further to go or a newsroom whose editor is more demanding. But the scores are useful in identifying areas where that newsroom needs to focus its unbolting work. And the scores will provide some measure of improvement if the same editor, however demanding or lenient, makes the same ratings in another month or six months or year.</p>
<p>As I compiled those scores for the editors, I quickly saw some potential pitfalls even in using simple ratings like that. I first compiled average scores in each of six areas: news coverage and storytelling, processes, engagement, planning and management, mobile and standards. Then I compiled an overall average.</p>
<p>But which is the better way to compile the overall average: Take the average of the six areas or an overall average of all the scores of individual characteristics. News coverage and storytelling included nine characteristics and processes six. So if news coverage and storytelling is 50 percent more important than processes, it&#8217;s probably better to get the average of all the characteristics. But if each major area is equally important, an average of the six would be the best way to get an overall score.</p>
<p>Either of those averages assumes some equality in the importance of the characteristics, either overall or within a category. And they aren&#8217;t equally important. (We&#8217;re deciding now which are most important for each of the pilot newsrooms.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also need to measure success in pursuing each of the characteristics. The quality and type of metrics to measure success will vary widely. For instance, under live coverage, one of the characteristics of news coverage and storytelling, we could measure several ways:</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive. </strong>We could describe a newsroom today as using live coverage in big breaking news stories and big events, but not using it routinely. And after changing how we cover, we could describe a newsroom as routinely using live coverage (a mix of livetweeting, liveblogs and video livestreaming) for all breaking news and for all events (unless we have a good reason not to, such as a judge not allowing cell phones or computers in court or lousy connectivity in a small-town gym), with frequent live chats about community events and issues. The difference is dramatic, but not actually measured, just described.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage. </strong>We could count the community events covered per week and note which of those were covered live by livetweeting, liveblogging, livestreaming, live chats or some combination. The percentage before and after would measure the culture change. These aren&#8217;t figures that are readily available from a service such as <a title="Wikipedia entry on Omniture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniture">Omniture</a>, <a title="ScribbleLive" href="http://scribblelive.com">ScribbleLive</a>, or <a title="Chartbeat" href="https://chartbeat.com/">Chartbeat</a>, but you could set up daily news budgets to note events and whether they are covered live and track those figures. You could review a week&#8217;s or month&#8217;s work to establish a baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Metric services. </strong>Services such as Omniture, ScribbleLive and <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> could provide various measures of your live coverage: <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">number of events, page views, unique visitors, engagement minutes. Each figure shows something different. For instance, your number of live events will climb simply from deciding to cover more events live. But then you analyze the other metrics to determine impact. Some types of events may draw a small audience but high engagement, so you decide they are successful. But if something isn&#8217;t drawing audience or engaging, you might tweak your live-coverage approach or decide not to continue covering that type of event live. Or not to cover it at all.</span></p>
<p>Not all of the characteristics of the unbolted newsroom lend themselves to numerical measurement. For instance, it&#8217;s important for newsroom meetings to have a strong digital focus. But how do you measure that? The number of meetings is a meaningless metric. More meetings aren&#8217;t necessarily better, especially if they are heavily focused on print planning.</p>
<p>A descriptive measurement is more appropriate here: Our morning meeting used to focus on the stories we were working on for the morning paper, with little or no discussion of digital plans such as video, interactive or live coverage or when stories would go online. Now our morning meeting reviews what is doing well on the site, what we&#8217;re covering during the day and when we can expect initial posts and updates, engagement plans on social media, any live events we&#8217;re covering. The difference is important, even if we&#8217;re not putting numbers on it.</p>
<p>Some goals will have only descriptive ways to measure progress. Others will have multiple measures. You need to decide what you want to measure and find the best way to measure it.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to become more effective at using Twitter, you might track your number of Twitter followers. We use a service called <a title="AdEverywhere" href="http://adeverywhere.com/">AdEverywhere</a> that provides weekly reports of followers and other basic metrics on Twitter and Facebook for all DFM branded accounts.</p>
<p>Twitter followers are a useful measurement, but also limited. That number almost always goes up because people who aren&#8217;t interested in your tweets will often scroll past them, rather than take the effort of unfollowing you. And you care more about how people are interacting with your tweets than how many people might see them.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted before, <a title="Engagement success: a chain reaction of sharing on social media" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/engagement-success-a-chain-reaction-of-sharing-on-social-media/">the chain reaction of people sharing your tweets or the content you tweet</a> can generate more traffic than you get simply from your followers.</p>
<p>Other services such as <a title="TweetReach" href="http://tweetreach.com/">TweetReach</a> and <a title="Twitter analytics" href="https://analytics.twitter.com/about">Twitter analytics</a> provide other tools for measuring Twitter performance. Each tool is probably helpful if you use it correctly and can be harmful if you use it wrong or don&#8217;t understand its limitations.</p>
<p><a title="Klout" href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> attempts to measure your influence (not just on Twitter, but on various social media), but its numbers are confusing and it occasionally changes its algorithm, making them more confusing. It is now inviting users to <a title="Don't just measure your Klout" href="http://blog.klout.com/2014/02/dont-just-measure-your-klout/">boost their influence</a> by using Klout to post to other social tools. I haven&#8217;t used the new tool yet, and I don&#8217;t fault Klout for experimenting with its business model, but I wonder about the accuracy of a tool that is going to raise your score for using the tool.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Measurements need to align with goals. When I was editor of the Minot Daily News in the early 1990s, the publisher and I shared the goal of improving our enterprise coverage. It was an important part of my pitch when I interviewed and of the expectations she voiced when hiring me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Later, when the publisher was interested in tracking reporters&#8217; byline counts, I said that was counter to the enterprise goal. Enterprise stories take more time than routine stories, and if reporters know they are being judged according to byline counts, they will crank out more routine stories, inflating some briefs into bylined stories instead of working on more enterprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">On the other hand, if a reporter wasn&#8217;t being very productive and I gave a goal of producing more stories, a byline count would be helpful in tracking the reporter&#8217;s performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Here&#8217;s how you measure success:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify a goal. What is the change you want?</li>
<li>Identify a way (or a combination of ways) to measure the change.</li>
<li>Assess how well the measurements reflect the change.</li>
<li>Assess whether the effectiveness of the measurement is worth the time or cost of measuring.</li>
<li>Repeat multiple times for multiple goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you measure in trying to track success in your newsroom? Or in your personal work? What tools or techniques provide that measurement?</p>
<p><em>Two companion posts over the next few days will examine how metrics can be misleading, using sports statistics as an example, and what Steve Buttry&#8217;s blog analytics say about his blog&#8217;s success and challenges.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="project_unbolt-logo" /></p><p><em>The following post was originally published <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/journalists-reactions-to-project-unbolt/" target="_blank">on Steve Buttry&#8217;s blog.</a></em></p>
<p>Since last week&#8217;s <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">announcement of Project Unbolt</a>, various news-industry blogs have taken note:</p>
<p><a title="Sam Kirkland" href="https://twitter.com/samkirkla" target="_blank">Sam Kirkland</a> of <a title="How Digital First Media ..." href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/237781/how-digital-first-media-hopes-to-transform-workflow-culture-of-newspaper-factories/" target="_blank">Poynter</a> interviewed me and noted how we&#8217;re hoping to change our approaches to various types of stories (I&#8217;ll be blogging more about this soon):</p>
<blockquote><p>Newspapers have become comfortable publishing content online before it runs in print, but the nature of that content has been influenced by newspaper thinking throughout the planning, reporting, writing and editing process. So Project Unbolt is about going beyond publishing content first on digital; it’s about publishing content first on digital in a digital-native way.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;"><a title="Alastair Reid" href="https://twitter.com/AlastairReid3">Alastair Reid</a> of </span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;" title="How Digital First Media plans ..." href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/how-digital-first-media-plan-to-unbolt-local-newsrooms/s2/a555737/">Journalism.co.uk</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;"> interviewed me and we discussed the same topic:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>In terms of coverage, Buttry said DFM newsrooms &#8220;want to move to live coverage as a default setting&#8221; for diary or time-sensitive events, while newsworthy elements of longer, more time-intensive stories will be reported digitally before a comprehensive print publication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the first story plant the flag in the ground, start a conversation and do some crowdsourcing?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;And then it unfolds in digital formats with interactive databases and live chats and we might publish documents online, similar to what the Guardian did with the MPs expenses, and ask the readers to help find stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we publish something online on a Wednesday, because it&#8217;s timely, then after a few days of discussion we&#8217;ll publish it in print on a Saturday. It doesn&#8217;t need to be online the day before if it is in print,&#8221; he said of how the digital and print processes may change. &#8220;These are the things we&#8217;ll be working on, and becoming more efficient at, in the print production from the digital content.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a title="Michael Depp" href="http://www.netnewscheck.com/tag/michael-depp">Michael Depp</a> of <a title="At Digital First, what &quot;unbolting&quot; really means" href="http://www.netnewscheck.com/article/31914/at-digital-first-what-unbolting-really-means">NetNewsCheck</a> also addressed the changes in storytelling (I really need to address this soon):</p>
<blockquote><p>But what do these kinds of workflow changes really come down to? Who at DFM is holding the machetes, hacking the first traces of a path into this purely digital future? And what should other media companies be looking for to steal for their own playbooks in terms of concrete practices with measurable results?</p>
<p>The early answers are surfacing among editors leading the project and the work of DFM’s more independent experimenters, some of whom are working at papers outside of the pilot. All of them are pointing to questions that, sooner or later, every journalist working in the digital age will have to squarely face. The biggest one: Is a story the final product of the reporting process?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>More than just refocusing attention to mobile reporting, engaging with audiences over social media or creating new ways to play with and use data, Project Unbolt is about actually changing how newsrooms think and act.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[As Digital First Media works to “unbolt” our newsrooms from print processes and culture, we need a vision of the “unbolted” newsroom. Steve Buttry outlines the six core characteristics.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="project_unbolt-logo" /></p><p>As Digital First Media works to <a title="Here’s how Digital First Media’s Project Unbolt will work" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/">“unbolt” our newsrooms from print processes and culture</a>, we need a vision of the “unbolted” newsroom.</p>
<p>This post will elaborate on the characteristics of an unbolted newsroom, the goal of Project Unbolt, which <a title="Project Unbolt" href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/project_unbolt/">DFM announced</a> yesterday, following <a title="Now what?" href="http://jxpaton.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/now-what/">John Paton&#8217;s first public mention of the project</a> last week.</p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s post, I <a title="Here’s how Digital First Media’s Project Unbolt will work" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">described this newsroom</a> generally, saying it will change in six characteristics (not listed in any particular order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Coverage and storytelling</li>
<li>Processes</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Planning and management</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Standards</li>
</ol>
<p>Here I&#8217;ll describe in some depth how the unbolted newsroom works and thinks in each of these respects. How newsrooms will achieve each of these priorities will vary according to a variety of circumstances such as size, clusterwide operations and the creativity and talents of local staff. The issues and techniques listed here are not exhaustive and do not preclude local newsrooms from pursuing digital priorities not spelled out here.</p>
<p>I welcome suggestions about points I&#8217;ve omitted here or better ways to make my points. I&#8217;ll update as I get suggestions. Leave your suggestions in the comments below.</p>
<h2>1. Coverage and Storytelling</h2>
<h3>Live</h3>
<p>Virtually all event coverage and breaking news coverage are handled as live coverage, with <a title="ScribbleLive" href="http://scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a>, <a title="Suggestions (but not standards) for live tweeting" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/suggestions-but-not-standards-for-live-tweeting/" target="_blank">livetweeting</a>, livestreaming, etc. This includes sports events, government meetings, trials, community festivals, etc.</p>
<p>Live coverage is routine for the unbolted newsroom. Reporters and/or visual journalists covering events plan for live coverage unless they have a good reason not to (a judge won’t allow phones or computers in a courtroom; a family would rather not have you livetweet a funeral; connectivity at a site is poor).</p>
<h3>Timely</h3>
<p>Digital platforms feature fresh news every morning. Breaking news, fresh content and event coverage are posted during the day when they are timely. Evening tablet edition includes fresh content.</p>
<p>Instead of shooting for the deadlines of a morning newspaper, the newsroom strives to post accurate stories (text, video, interactive) quickly to digital platforms. This applies not just to breaking news and events but to other daily news stories: We strive when possible to publish during the workday when our audience is the strongest.</p>
<h3>Enterprise</h3>
<p>The biggest and best enterprise stories are planned as digital packages with elements such as video, interactive graphics and databases, published at optimal times for digital audience (perhaps not all at once).</p>
<p>We don’t publish these stories digitally on Sundays or Saturdays, but publish sometime during the week, with a print version publishing Sunday after digital publication. Publication might stretch over multiple days, starting Wednesday or Thursday with 2-3 days of new digital content, followed by a Sunday print story, followed by a live chat Monday. Sunday stories reviewing a week’s big news story publish digitally before noon on Friday, unless new developments Friday morning demand the reporter’s attention for timely digital posting.</p>
<p>We may not develop a single standard way to publish enterprise content, but possibly multiple standard approaches and occasional special methods. Our efforts to refine our processes for enterprise stories will be guided by digital tools and opportunities and a sense of experimentation, rather than by our need to fill the Sunday newspaper.</p>
<h3>Opinion</h3>
<p>Opinion content is a mix of editorials, columns, cartoons, staff blogs, community blogs, live chats, videos and other interactive content. We need to lead the community conversation, as we always have through our editorial pages. But we need to develop that leadership more aggressively and creatively using digital tools. And we need to join, stimulate and curate the other conversations going on in the community.</p>
<h3>Beat blogs</h3>
<p>Reporters work primarily in <a title="13 ways a reporter should use a beat blog" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/13-ways-a-reporter-should-use-a-beat-blog/" target="_blank">beat blogs</a>, publishing content for niche audiences, freed from the deadlines, space considerations and story structure of the print product. Blog posts will be promoted from the home page, on section fronts and social media as warranted. Reporters and/or editors will edit blog posts for publication in print products as needed.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The newsroom develops data skills – both specialists and basic data skills throughout the newsroom. The unbolted newsroom experiments with ways to use data for journalism, <a title="Be the Answer: Using interactive databases to provide answers and generate revenue" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/be-the-answer-using-interactive-databases-to-provide-answers-and-generate-revenue/" target="_blank">interactive databases</a>, data visualization and structuring and updating archival content for continuing value.</p>
<h3>Photos</h3>
<p>Reporters and visual journalists file photos quickly from breaking news scenes and events. Newsroom regularly solicits and curates photos from community. Visual journalists produce frequent Media Center photo galleries.</p>
<h3>Video</h3>
<p>Reporters and video journalists produce and quickly post Touts with most stories. Newsroom livestreams important events and breaking stories. Newsroom produces frequent webcasts. Newsroom solicits and curates community videos. Visual journalists produce storytelling videos with big stories.</p>
<h3>Interactive</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom experiments with storytelling and curation tools to make stories more interactive with quizzes, interactive databases, maps, polls, timelines and other features that help users experience stories, rather than simply reading or watching them.</p>
<p>Journalists master the tools that prove useful for frequent jobs, but are continually experimenting with new tools and techniques.</p>
<h1>2. Processes</h1>
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>Newsroom workflow focuses on production of content first and primarily for digital platforms. While content management systems dictate parts of workflow, newsroom works with CMS developers to improve the workflow.</p>
<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<p>Daily stories that are not breaking stories or events being covered live get deadlines based on digital needs: maybe 11:30 a.m. if possible to catch the lunch-hour readers or 3:30 if possible to make an evening tablet edition. Late-afternoon or evening deadlines are only for events happening then.</p>
<h3>Editing</h3>
<p>Editing time and energy are focused on ensuring and improving quality of content before (or quickly after) digital publication.</p>
<p>An exception might be reassignment of one or more editor in a new version of the old “rewrite” role, rewriting print stories from live event coverage so that in some cases, the reporter covering an event doesn’t ever write a “story,” but might produce lots of tweets, Touts and other updates that feed a liveblog, and an editor crafts some of that into the print story. (The rewrite role might live in the regional production hub, rather than in the local newsroom.)</p>
<h3>Headlines</h3>
<p>Reporters and local editors write strong SEO headlines for content. As needed, editors in local newsrooms and production hubs edit those headlines for print.</p>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>The newsroom promotes local stories and Thunderdome&#8217;s national content (localized where appropriate) on social media. Reporters, visual journalists and/or editors write conversational posts for Facebook, Twitter and Google+, posting images where appropriate. Visual content is also posted frequently to Tout, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and other relevant social media.</p>
<h3>Print production</h3>
<p>As much as the content management system allows, print production will be limited significantly to the production hub. Local involvement will be minimized, perhaps to designating content for page one and section fronts and reviewing pages before publication.</p>
<h1>3. Engagement</h1>
<h3><b></b>Transparency</h3>
<p>The editor explains newsroom decisions and developments regularly in a blog, social media and community appearances. The staff are encouraged to share the “story behind the story” in social media and blogs as well as community appearances.</p>
<p>Where time permits, newsroom invites community input before and during news coverage. The newsroom engages regularly with the community in person by such means as a community editorial board, community meetings, posting of daily budgets and open and/or livestreamed planning meetings.</p>
<p>The newsroom discloses potential conflicts — personal or business connections with the people and organizations covered.</p>
<h3>Conversation</h3>
<p>Branded social media accounts and individual journalists’ social media accounts have a conversational tone that engages the community as well as promoting digital content. Crowdsourcing and curation are part of the daily routine, asking the community about stories and harvesting content created by the community.<b></b></p>
<h3><b></b>Social media</h3>
<p>Everyone in the newsroom is active on social media, including at least Twitter, Facebook, Tout and Google+, using them and other tools such as Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Foursquare for gathering news, engaging the community, reporting news and posting links to digital content.</p>
<h3>Curation</h3>
<p>The newsroom regularly curates content from the community from blogs, social media and news releases, from organizations and people in the community telling their own stories and from other professional media.</p>
<h3>Hangout</h3>
<p>When possible and when sources are willing, journalists use Hangout rather than telephone for interviews with people they can’t meet in person, using YouTube to livecast and record the interview for use on digital platforms. The newsroom uses Hangout/YouTube (or other video tools) regularly for livecasts with journalists in the field.</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>The newsroom has an active network of community blogs and community social media accounts which are promoted on the digital news products and engaged with the newsroom in various products. Newsroom staffers regularly recruit new members to the network. The newsroom experiments with different ways of curating content from the network. The newsroom engages in person with network members through <a title="Heritage Media teaches media skills in Michigan communities" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/heritage-media-teaches-media-skills-in-michigan-communities/" target="_blank">training</a> and other events and through <a title="Pottstown Mercury engages bloggers in community food drive" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/pottstown-mercury-engages-bloggers-in-community-food-drive/" target="_blank">collaboration on community projects.</a></p>
<h3>Other engagement<b> </b></h3>
<p>The newsroom has strong community engagement, involving a combination of events, outreach, contests and in-person engagement by inviting the community into the newsroom and by engaging out in the community. Staff members engage with comments about their work on the website and in social media.</p>
<h1>4. Planning and management</h1>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>The daily <a title="Advice for editors: Lead Digital First meetings" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/advice-for-editors-lead-digital-first-meetings/" target="_blank">planning meeting</a>, if any, is in the morning, focused on the day’s news coverage plans, early traffic and engagement, stressing the need for early posting and frequent updates for unfolding stories. The morning meeting does not focus on the morning newspaper.</p>
<p>If the newsroom has an afternoon meeting, it reviews the day’s digital coverage and looks ahead to evening event coverage and the morning newspaper as well as news that&#8217;s expected the next day. This should be a smaller meeting but probably can be handled with the print editor conferring individually with the appropriate people.</p>
<p>Enterprise meetings plan interactive elements, video, data and other content that will require significant planning.</p>
<h3>News budgets</h3>
<p>Daily and long-term news budgets list digital coverage tools and techniques that stories will use and list live coverage plans and deadlines for posting initial takes of unfolding stories.</p>
<h3>Staffing</h3>
<p>More staff specialists focus on digital duties such as mobile, social media, data visualization and interactive graphics than on print duties such as page design and print graphics (allowing for the skewed regional duties of a newsroom serving as a regional print hub.)</p>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom uses digital metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of content and engagement and to provide more relevant, engaging content and experiences. All staff members have access to metrics and know how their performance will be measured. The newsroom works to refine and improve its use and understanding of metrics.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>The newsroom works closely with sales and technology colleagues to ensure opportunities to develop effective products and maximize revenue without jeopardizing editorial integrity.</p>
<h3>Staff development</h3>
<p>Each staff member has a personal digital plan, worked out with his or her supervisor and the top editor, and is held accountable for following the plan for personal digital growth.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Editors place a high priority on training in staff time and in budgeting. Staff members who have mastered important skills or experimented with new tools train their colleagues. The newsroom participates in DFM training opportunities such as webinars, <a title="Slides and links for Northern California engagement workshops" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/12/07/slides-and-links-for-northern-california-engagement-workshops/" target="_blank">regional workshops</a> and competition for DFM slots at national conferences.</p>
<p>Editors and staff members watch for external training opportunities, such as state press association conferences, seminars offered by national organizations such as <a title="The Poynter Institute" href="http://poynter.org" target="_blank">Poynter</a> or the <a title="Knight Digital Media Center" href="http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/">Knight Digital Media Center</a> or online training such as courses offered by <a title="News University" href="http://www.newsu.org/" target="_blank">News University</a> or <a title="Lynda" href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda</a>.</p>
<p>The newsroom shares training opportunities with members of its community network.</p>
<h1>5. Mobile</h1>
<h3>Use of mobile tools</h3>
<p>Editors and staff in the unbolted newsroom routinely use mobile tools in their work and in personal news consumption. Most of staff routinely uses newsroom’s app and/or m-dot site.</p>
<h3>Planning and monitoring</h3>
<p>In daily planning meetings, editors check and discuss presentation of content on various mobile platforms and tools. Planning always includes mobile platforms.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>The newsroom has a designated mobile leader and the top editor places a high priority on mobile.</p>
<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>Engagement efforts deliberately seek to invite participation on mobile devices. Contests and conversations explicitly invite engagement on mobile devices at community events.</p>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<p>The newsroom develops mobile and/or community apps for coverage of special events or major community issues or interests.</p>
<h3>Mobile products</h3>
<p>Newsroom offers products to engage and inform the community routinely on mobile devices, such as customized text and/or email alerts, email newsletters and tools that facilitate community reporting.</p>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>Editors follow mobile metrics closely, using their analysis to improve coverage and deliver content that engages and interests the community.</p>
<h3>News gathering</h3>
<p>Staff members use mobile tools routinely to gather content and report from the field.<b> </b></p>
<h1>6. Standards</h1>
<h3><b>Accuracy </b></h3>
<p>Our content must be accurate. Journalists should verify facts before publication in social media or any of our own platforms. We must say how we know what we know and we must say what we don’t know. Staff are trained in verification of information gathered from the community from social media and other platforms.</p>
<p>The newsroom should have an accuracy checklist and expect journalists to use it to prevent errors.</p>
<h3>Corrections</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom corrects all errors that editors or staff members become aware of. Every story should have a link to a form readers can use to notify the newsroom of errors. The newsroom corrects errors in stories and adds notes saying the story (or other content) has been corrected and what the error was (unless the error was potentially defamatory). The newsroom should also publish all corrections in one place that is easily found in website navigation.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>The newsroom should have an updated code of ethics and should regularly discuss ethics and how to apply ethical standards in new situations the staff might face.</p>
<h3>Attribution</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom names and links to all digital sources of information, including the competition, even if linking is not easy in the content management system. Where possible, journalists should embed digital content, rather than quoting it. Stories should link to or embed source documents.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>Editors should model and uphold strong ethical standards while leading newsroom conversations about how to make ethical decisions in new processes and circumstances.</p>
<h3>Social media</h3>
<p>Journalists should be personable and professional in interactions with the public, including on social media.</p>
<h3>Accountability</h3>
<p>Managers and staff members have digital goals and their performance is primarily measured by and rewarded for digital achievement.</p>
<h1>Project Unbolt blog</h1>
<p>I will be blogging about the work of <a href="http://www.projectunbolt.com" target="_blank">Project Unbolt here on InsideThunderdome</a>, crossposting to <a title="The Buttry Diary" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com" target="_blank">The Buttry Diary</a>, my personal blog.</p>
<p>Editors and staff members of the pilot newsrooms for Project Unbolt (<a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a>, <a title="Berkshire Eagle" href="http://berkshireeagle.com" target="_blank">Berkshire Eagle</a>, <a title="El Paso Times" href="http://elpasotimes.com" target="_blank">El Paso Times</a> and <a title="News-Herald" href="http://news-herald.com" target="_blank">News-Herald</a>) will also be blogging about the project as they learn lessons from their successes and mistakes.</p>
<p>We also invite our Digital First colleagues to blog about your unbolting efforts. Other newsrooms won&#8217;t get my attention initially at the same level as the pilot newsrooms, but we&#8217;re not expecting them to be spectators in the unbolting process. Let me know — <a href="mailto: sbuttry@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">sbuttry@digitalfirstmedia.com</a> — if you&#8217;d like to blog about your unbolting efforts.</p>
<h1>What do you think?</h1>
<p>We also invite guest posts offering advice and observations about the unbolting process from journalists outside our company or from people in the communities we serve. Contact me if you&#8217;re interested in contributing.</p>
<p>Disagreements are welcome here, too. If you think we should change our unbolting priorities or if you think we&#8217;re going about it wrong or trying some things that won&#8217;t work, feel free to suggest a guest post.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested, though, in guest posts advocating a more cautious path. You are welcome to express nostalgia or fret about the decline of print in the comments. But Project Unbolt is about moving forward and that&#8217;s what the blog will be about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="project_unbolt-logo" /></p><p>Digital First Media newsrooms are still largely print newsrooms with digital operations &#8220;bolted on.&#8221;</p>
<p>That truth hurt at a meeting in Denver last year, when DFM CEO <a title="John Paton" href="https://twitter.com/jxpaton" target="_blank">John Paton</a> used the description in a meeting of our company&#8217;s senior editors. Our newsrooms have made lots of changes to increase and improve our use of digital tools and our engagement on digital platforms. But I had to nod my head when John said it. I&#8217;ve <a title="My Digital First Media world tour: 84 newsrooms (so far)" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/my-digital-first-media-world-tour-84-newsrooms-so-far/">visited all of our daily newsrooms</a> and some of our non-dailies and the statement rang true.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo.png"><img class="alignright" alt="Project Unbolt logo" src="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo.png?w=247" width="247" height="300" /></a>So we&#8217;re going to take a massive wrench to the culture and workflow of our newsrooms and unbolt them. Welcome to <a title="Project Unbolt press release" href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/project_unbolt/">Project Unbolt</a>.</p>
<p>As John explained last week in his <a title="Now what?" href="http://jxpaton.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/now-what/" target="_blank">address to the Online Publishers Association</a>, &#8220;Starting with some test sites we will work through every process, every workflow step of what makes a digital newsroom digital and make that the very core of what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started working on the plan for Project Unbolt almost as soon as John used the metaphor. He was right and we needed to change our newsrooms&#8217; culture and workflow so he couldn&#8217;t repeat that observation this year.</p>
<p>John told the OPA, &#8220;The newsroom of the future is not the current one dragged into it. It is going to be re-built from the ground up.&#8221;</p>
<p>So here is our plan for doing that: unbolting or rebuilding or whatever metaphor you want to use to change our newsrooms into that &#8220;newsroom of the future.&#8221; The plan will be updated as we benefit from more staff members&#8217; ideas and as we learn from our successes and mistakes, but here&#8217;s the plan we&#8217;re starting with:</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>We need to “unbolt” Digital First newsrooms, so that they are Digital First in culture, processes and priorities. Though digital in focus, the operations should remain capable (as long as needed) of publishing print products, but the regional print operations will be what is bolted on to the core digital newsroom.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>We will identify key characteristics of an unbolted newsroom. All newsrooms will assess where they are in achieving those characteristics and identify goals to help them move toward unbolting.</p>
<p>I will guide that process for all newsrooms, but my primary role initially will be to embed for an extended visit to the <a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a>, seeking to accelerate and guide that newsroom’s unbolting.</p>
<p>I also will work closely with three other newsrooms that will be working at the same time on their accelerated unbolting plan: the <a href="http://berkshireeagle.com" target="_blank">Berkshire Eagle</a>, <a href="http://elpasotimes.com" target="_blank">El Paso Times</a> and the <a href="http://news-herald.com" target="_blank">News-Herald</a> in Willoughby, Ohio. I will make shorter visits to their newsrooms after the extended visit to New Haven.</p>
<p>I will continue guiding New Haven and the other pilots from afar and with occasional shorter visits, but I will move on to a different size and/or type of newsroom for a second extended visit.</p>
<p>Through a blog and training, we will share the unbolting lessons companywide and beyond.</p>
<h3>Tactics</h3>
<ol>
<li>Digital First Media&#8217;s senior editors have agreed on the general characteristics of an unbolted newsroom (recognizing that they will vary by size and other factors).</li>
<li>Each editor (or perhaps the entire newsroom) will assess each newsroom by those characteristics on a scale of 1-5, with cluster and/or regional editor checking the score and discussing areas of disagreement.</li>
<li>Each editor will choose three priority areas to work on where the newsroom scored low. Cluster editors and I will work with the editors to develop plans for raising those scores by at least two notches in three months.</li>
<li>I will spend an extended period (about 6 weeks, most of February and March) at the New Haven Register, working with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mattderienzo" target="_blank">Matt DeRienzo</a> and his staff to unbolt it completely and make it a model for the Digital First unbolted newsroom.</li>
<li>At the same time, the Berkshire Eagle, El Paso Times and News-Herald will work on their own unbolting plans. I will make shorter visits to those newsrooms and assist in their unbolting from afar while I&#8217;m in New Haven.</li>
<li>Local editors retain all authority for making day-to-day news judgments, assignments, etc. I will focus on working with editors to change newsroom operations such as processes and structure and may make staffing recommendations. I will work collaboratively with the local editors, with a shared understanding that a major purpose of this project is to push the editor and staff beyond their comfort zones.</li>
<li>We will develop metrics before the project to measure as best we can changes in digital audience and engagement, print audience, digital and print revenue and other performance measures. We will also seek to measure changes in newsroom processes, production and culture.</li>
<li>We will examine and consider changes in all newsroom workflows, including handling of local and Thunderdome content, promotion of content in social media and digital and print production.</li>
<li>Project Unbolt will include some training by Thunderdome staff and/or external trainers.</li>
<li>Project Unbolt probably will include some significant newsroom reorganization, but will concentrate more on what the newsroom does than on structure.</li>
<li>Depending on the cluster situation of the newsroom, Project Unbolt will include some work with other newsrooms in the cluster, such as development of a cluster breaking news team or investigative team. The cluster and regional editors will be involved throughout the project, but especially in any changes that extended beyond the individual newsroom. The four pilot newsrooms have different cluster situations, so this might play out differently in each case.</li>
<li>After completion of the first newsroom unbolting project, we will select a second newsroom for unbolting. The purpose of the second project will be fine-tuning based on lessons of the first project and applying the principles to a different type of newsroom.</li>

<h2>Characteristics of an unbolted newsroom</h2>
<p>Here are some characteristics of an unbolted newsroom (though the details might vary by size and other circumstances as well as by the creativity of the editor and newsroom):</p>
<h3>Coverage and Storytelling</h3>
<p>Newsroom efforts are focused on covering news and producing stories for digital platforms. Stories are live (when possible), interactive, visual and relevant.</p>
<h3><b></b>Processes</h3>
<p>Newsroom processes are designed to provide quality, accurate content quickly for digital platforms, with print editors harvesting and adapting digital content to produce print editions.</p>
<h3><b></b>Engagement</h3>
<p>Newsroom engages the community effectively through a variety of tools and techniques: social media, blog networks, crowdsourcing, curation, contests, live chats and in-person engagement.</p>
<h3>Planning and Management</h3>
<p>Meetings, budgets, staffing, training, goals and communication reflect the newsroom’s digital priorities.</p>
<h3>Mobile</h3>
<p>In planning and execution, newsroom staff thinks of mobile audience and delivers strong mobile content. Staff uses mobile tools to gather content and post from the field.</p>
<h3><b></b>Standards</h3>
<p>In processes, communications and discipline, newsroom reflects commitment to providing original (or attributed), accurate, verified content; to correcting errors quickly and transparently; to avoiding conflicts and disclosing unavoidable conflicts; to accountability.</p>
<p>I will elaborate on the six characteristics described above in a subsequent post.</p>
