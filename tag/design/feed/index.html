				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnd620x4001-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnd620x400" /></p><p>Every fall, the <a href="http://www.snd.org/" target="_blank">Society for News Design</a> (SND) holds an <a href="http://www.snd.org/about/annual-workshops/" target="_blank">annual workshop</a> that attracts hundreds of journalists from around the globe who are interested in design, illustration and programming. As the industry has moved digital, so has SND, with a shift in focus to user experience, mobile design, multimedia and digital innovation. Digital First Media will send two of our own to <a href="http://www.sndlou.com/index.html" target="_blank">this year&#8217;s event in Louisville, Kentucky</a>, Nov. 7-9.</p>
<p><strong>Interested?</strong><br />
We are on the hunt for two journalists — one from a 21st Century Media newsroom, the other from a MediaNews Group newsroom — that we can send to SND. Just like our <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">ONA contest</a>, DFM will cover the registration and hotel cost, but not travel expenses, though attendees can request travel compensation from their newsroom. The selected participants will be tasked with spreading what they learn to the rest of DFM by live tweeting at least one workshop or keynote, and contributing two guest posts to Inside Thunderdome after the event.</p>
<p><strong>The selection process and how to enter<br />
</strong>To be considered, it&#8217;s as simple as approaching the editor of your newsroom and asking him or her to make a case for you. The <a href="https://twitter.com/DFMThunderdome/lists/dfm-senior-editors" target="_blank">company&#8217;s senior editors</a> have each been asked to nominate one journalist from their cluster by Thurs., Oct. 3. Their decisions will be based on the suggestions from the editors in their region. The clusters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bay Area News Group</li>
<li>Los Angeles News Group</li>
<li>NorCal</li>
<li>Utah + Colorado</li>
<li>TexMex</li>
<li>The Midwest</li>
<li>Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Vermont</li>
<li>Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly after the nominations are in, we will post a ballot right here on Inside Thunderdome and let the public decide which two of those finalists will represent DFM at SND this November.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the contest, the entry process or the workshop, please leave a comment or email me directly at <a href="mailto:cmarch@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">cmarch@digitalfirstmedia.com</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Graphic Artist Tom McKay and Lead Designer Jeff Neumann of the Denver Post won the DFMie for the best design of 2012 for the Colorado Ski Guide. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Colorado-Ski-Guide-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Colorado Ski Guide" /></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">Graphic Artist <a title="Tom McKay" href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/beyondthedata/author/thomas-mckay/">Tom McKay</a> and Lead Designer <a title="Jeff Neumann" href="http://www.jeff-neumann.com/">Jeff Neumann</a> of the Denver Post won the DFMie for the best design of 2012 for the <a title="Colorado Ski Guide" href="http://www.denverpost.com/skiing/ci_22074776/download-denver-post-2012-13-colorado-ski-guide">Colorado Ski Guide</a>. </span></p>
<p>Their editors’ nomination explained the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ski Guide was the first entry in The Denver Post&#8217;s e-book initiative, which repurposes published content to create books for mobile devices. Its sleek and simple design style, showing volumes of content in an ordered, easy-to-understand structure, was among the reasons why it won a November DFMie.</p>
<p>This design by Jeff Neumann and Tom McKay takes the best of print design, with emphasis on order and style, and adds the best of digital design, with emphasis on interactivity and layered information. Readers receive a guide with useful information; DFM gets the blueprint for a new digital future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why this was the design winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Denver Post Ski Guide was an innovative project that integrated a series of stories, user-friendly tips, photographs, maps, and other interactive elements in a beautiful presentation. The design is clean and intuitive, with multiple layers of information embedded within each section. The iPad format allows for a unique experience depending on a user&#8217;s needs and interests, and all together provides a comprehensive guide to a local pastime.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other design finalists chosen by the judges were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="Paul Penzella" href="http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Paul-Penzella/551727705">Paul Penzella</a> of the Daily Breeze for a <a title="College football preview app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2012-college-football-preview/id555763521?mt=8">college football preview app</a> for the iPad.</span></li>

</ul>
<p>The Colorado Ski Guide also won the <a title="November DFMies: Breaking News, Investigations, Ebook" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/01/21/november-dfmies-breaking-news-investigations-ebook/">November DFMie</a> for the Colorado/Utah cluster of DFM.</p>
<div id="attachment_3190" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/colorado-ski-guide-wins-dfmie-design/tom-mckay/" rel="attachment wp-att-3190"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3190" alt="Tom McKay" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Tom-McKay-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tom McKay</p></div>
<p>For the past 15 years McKay has worked as a graphic artist at The Denver Post. Prior to that he was a graphic artist or graphics editor at several newspapers in Colorado and Florida going back to 1986 when the Macintosh computer was still a novelty. “I used to think explaining things with pictures and words was the best thing a person could aspire to,” McKay says. “That was before you could make them truly interactive.”</p>
<p>Neumann was born with white hair in Ohio before man landed on the moon. He grew up in Orange County, Calif., but was &#8220;saved&#8221; by the first wave of SoCal punk rock in the 70s.</p>
<div id="attachment_3191" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/colorado-ski-guide-wins-dfmie-design/jeff-neumann/" rel="attachment wp-att-3191"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3191" alt="Jeff Neumann" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Jeff-Neumann-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jeff Neumann</p></div>
<p>Graduating from the Cal State system with a master of arts in drawing and painting/printmaking, Neumann, naturally enough, went to work for newspapers. He enjoyed the &#8220;blue-collar&#8221; aspects of creating something every day that would be thrown away the next.</p>
<p>Neumann did short stints at the Los Angeles Daily News, Albuquerque Tribune and Chicago Tribune; then longer stints back at The Albuquerque Tribune (to marry photojournalist Dorothy Milligan) and the Seattle Times. For the last eight years, Neumann has been lead designer at the Denver Post.</p>
<p>He light-rails in to work from a suburban home behind the infamous Columbine High School, where Dorothy, the Replacements (daughter Anica and son Coby) and a mini-Aussie named Brodee complete the team. His hair has darkened to brown.</p>
