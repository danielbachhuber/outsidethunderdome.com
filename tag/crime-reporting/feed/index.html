				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Robert-Mills-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Robert Mills" /></p><p><a title="Robert Mills" href="https://twitter.com/Robert_Mills">Robert Mills</a> of the Lowell Sun wins the DFMie as the best staff blogger of Digital First Media.</p>
<p>His editor&#8217;s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rob Mills, The Sun&#8217;s night police reporter, gets it. His <a title="Police Line" href="http://blogs.lowellsun.com/policeline/">Police Line</a> blog is not a dumping ground for breaking news. Mills adds photos, edits and embeds his own video, and provides added detail and context to his work. He also engages his followers in the behind-the-scenes ethical questions that he encounters. Our readers have responded; his blog is the most read on <a href="http://lowellsun.com">lowellsun.com</a> by a factor of four or five. He is a worthy candidate for this award.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DFMie judges agreed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our pick is Police Line, from the Lowell Sun. It&#8217;s good, passionate and tireless work from the perspective of a veteran reporter who conveys his journalistic and human values, as well as his love for the community he covers. The blog is rich with an unusual level of detail and photos that put the reader right at the scene. One notable recent post even included a well-written account of an accident sent in by a 13-year-old resident who responded to the scene along with police, fire and ambulance. Talk about user-generated content. We also appreciated the spurs for community action at the end of each post. Police Line is worth a regular visit even if you don&#8217;t live in the Lowell, Mass., area.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for staff blogger were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="Evan Brandt" href="https://twitter.com/pottstownnews">Evan Brandt</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., for his <a title="Evan Brandt's Digital Notebook" href="http://evan-brandt.blogspot.com/2012/05/welfare-for-white-and-wealthy.html">Digital Notebook</a>, where he posted daily, 365 posts in 2012. Brandt was also a finalist for Mid-Sized Daily Journalist of the Year.</span></li>
<li><a title="Fred J. Robledo" href="https://twitter.com/SGVNSports">Fred Robledo</a>, Local Sports Editor for the Los Angeles News Group for his <a title="Fred J. Robledo on Prep Sports" href="http://www.insidesocal.com/tribpreps/2012/08/24/friday-night-co-1/">San Gabriel Valley Tribune  prep sports blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mills has been at The Sun since Sept. 9, 2002. He has worked for MediaNews Group since Jan. 24, 2000, first at the Lebanon Daily News, and then at the Fitchburg Sentinel. He attended Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa., as a journalism major, but left a semester early to go to work in Lebanon.</p>
<p>He has a 10-month-old daughter Charlotte Mills and lives in Lowell with his girlfriend Giovanna Aviles. &#8220;I&#8217;m a stay-at-home dad by day, and then a crime reporter at night. I love the night shift (4 to midnight) because it means I&#8217;m home with my daughter each day.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">&#8220;Sad as it usually is, I love reporting on crime and spot news,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;I think we need to confront our readers with the sad reality that occurs most days in our cities, and I think graphic reporting on the violence and tragedy that is part of this beat is the best way to help our society understand and deal with the issues. &#8230; </span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">I think I&#8217;m privileged to tell the stories of people and incidents that many people would like to ignore.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a title="Brian Charles" href="https://twitter.com/JBrianCharles">Brian Charles</a> of the Pasadena Star-News is the Journalist of the Year for Digital First Media&#8217;s newsrooms publishing mid-sized dailies.</p>
<p>Charles is recognized for his coverage of the Pasadena police. He is one of four finalists for Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. That winner will be announced in September, when DFMie winners will be honored in Denver.</p>
<p>His editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reporter Brian Charles is a rising star in the Los Angeles News Group and DFM. His year-long coverage of the officer-involved <a title="Questions remain in the shooting of Kendrec McDade" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_22857548/one-year-later-questions-remain-shooting-death-kendrec?IADID=Search-www.pasadenastarnews.com-www.pasadenastarnews.com">shooting of an unarmed, black teenager named Kendrec McDade by Pasadena police officers</a> in pursuit of a robbery suspect uncovered <a title="More allegations come forward in Pasadena police probe" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_22904838">questionable patterns and practices in the city&#8217;s homicide bureau</a>. It also led defense attorneys, former police officers and citizens to come forward with information that helped him to shine even more light on these patterns and practices.</p>
<p>Brian&#8217;s follow-up reporting led to the suspension of one detective and the demotion of another. More importantly, his reporting has prompted investigations by the FBI and Los Angeles County Office of Independent Review into the Pasadena Police Department and its homicide bureau. Those probes, which are continuing, already have resulted in a mistrial in a homicide case where it was discovered that two police officers intimidated a witness and hid exculpatory evidence. The Los Angeles County District Attorney&#8217;s Office is frantically examining other cases involving those two Pasadena police officers.</p>
<p>As a young father, it would have been easy for Brian to have stopped digging when he uncovered some of this information. Some segments of law enforcement turned up the heat on him to leave well enough alone. But despite that, he doggedly carried on and continued to seek the truth. His search is far from over, but already it has been noticed at the city, county, state and federal levels.</p>
<p>What makes Brian&#8217;s work even more impressive is he had much more on his plate than simply reporting on the Pasadena Police Department. As the lead writer in the Star-News&#8217; newsroom, Brian covered Pasadena City Hall and politics this past year. It was all part of his beat, one that was bigger than most in LANG. And anytime Editor Frank Girardot needed somebody to jump on a breaking news story, Brian usually got the call and eagerly gave it his all. He also was among the reporters who contributed to LANG&#8217;s Christopher Dorner coverage.</p>
<p>Brian has engaged in the sort of reporting that stands as an example to other local journalists seeking a deeper understanding of their community and its dynamics. For those reasons I believe Brian should be the Journalist of the Year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges concurred:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Charles of the Pasadena Star-News is to be commended for staying on top of the death of an unarmed man by Pasadena police officers. His stories are clear, accessible and exhaustively reported. Others have noticed: One detective was suspended, another demoted, and an investigation has been launched. His coverage and writing voice have clearly matured and he renders updates on this important story with authority and accountability. Like many reporters at a paper of this size, Brian juggles his commitment to this story among many others. His juggling act is notable and, in one of the most competitive media environments in the world, he embodies the best of local journalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Journalist of the Year in mid-sized dailies were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="J.M. Brown" href="https://twitter.com/jmbrownreports">J.M. Brown</a> of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, for a <a title="J.M. Brown project on desalination" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/desal/ci_21646511">project on water desalination</a>.</span></li>
<li><a title="Pottstown News" href="https://twitter.com/pottstownnews">Evan Brandt</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., who was also a finalist for the <a title="Robert Mills Wins DFMie as Top Staff Blogger" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/lowell-sun/robert-mills-wins-dfmie-top-staff-blogger/">DFMie for best staff blogger</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A native New Yorker, Brian Charles graduated from the State University of New York at Purchase in 2005. He moved to California and began working in community news in 2006, starting at a rural weekly before moving to a small daily in 2008. In 2009, he was hired by the Pasadena Star-News to cover education, politics and breaking news. His work as a journalist has been recognized by the California Newspaper Publishing Association and in 2009 he won an Associated Press award for coverage of an on-campus suicide at a Los Angeles-area high school.</p>
<p>In March, Charles was promoted to a staff position the Daily Breeze, also a part of the Los Angeles News Group.</p>
<p>Charles lives in South Pasadena, with his wife, Michelle, and daughter, Natalie.</p>

<p>The nomination from Editor Julie Baxter detailed Quinn&#8217;s 2012 performance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Megan is a workhorse. Being the only staff writer for a twice-weekly requires that, but her work shines and serves Broomfield residents well. We are the primary news source in Broomfield and Megan does an excellent job of keeping folks in the know on issues large and small. The community and the Enterprise is lucky to have her.</p></blockquote>
<p>Links Baxter submitted in support of Quinn&#8217;s nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>This links shows her ability to cover a breaking news story (<a title="Broomfield woman killed Friday ..." href="http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/broomfield-news/ci_21760117/reports-shots-fired-commerce-street-broomfield">fatal shooting at auto repair shop</a>) and flesh out information long before officials were willing to release key details.</p>
<p>This link shows what Megan did on her day off, the day following the shooting, and how she added <a title="Broomfield police: Lawrence Crouch ..." href="http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/broomfield-news/ci_21765012/police-withhold-name-man-arrested-fatal-broomfield-shooting">context about the victim and suspect&#8217;s relationship and details about her life</a>. (Note the double byline b/c the name of the suspect was released well into the evening).</p>
<p>This link shows Megan’s ability to <a title="Man killed by Broomfield police officer ..." href="http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/broomfield-news/ci_20973447/man-killed-by-broomfield-police-officer-struggled-mental">write with compassion about a very sensitive subject</a>, again long before officials had released the victim’s name.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">DFMie judges explained why they chose Quinn:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Megan Quinn, notably on her day off, dug up details on a relationship between a murder victim—a woman who worked at a local Saab dealership—and the suspect, something police were reticent to comment on. The shoe-leather quality of her reporting is noteworthy and especially remarkable given the fact that she is the Broomfield Enterprise&#8217;s only staff writer. Quinn&#8217;s reporting on sensitive issues was sympathetic to both sides and offered context for a delicate news event. She balanced outside experts with family and witness testimony well to create a nuanced look at a tragic event in such a way that could help the community understand both what happened that day, and how it fits into national discussions surrounding gun control and mental health.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Non-Daily Journalist of the Year were <a title="Michael Guardabascio" href="https://twitter.com/Guardabascio">Michael Guardabascio</a>, sports editor of the Gazettes in the Los Angeles News Group, and <a title="Linda Finarelli" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/linda-finarelli/a/6a0/463">Linda Finarelli</a>, a reporter for Montgomery County Media in Montgomery County, Pa.</p>
<p>Megan Quinn is a community reporter who has spent the past year covering life in Broomfield, Colo., for the Broomfield Enterprise. She also covers religion for the Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p>Quinn, who got her journalism degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has worked for several publications across the Front Range including Colorado Community Media and the the Loveland Reporter-Herald. Quinn is an active runner, swimmer, homebrewer and birdwatcher who can’t pass up a beautiful day outside.</p>
