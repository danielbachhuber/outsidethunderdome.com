		<description><![CDATA[Frank Otto &#038; Steve Moore of The Mercury won the 2014 Use of Social Media DFMie for late-night curation of tweets from Boston Marathon manhunt.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/2014dfmies-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="2014dfmies" /></p><p><strong>Frank Otto</strong> and <strong>Steve Moore</strong> of The Mercury won the <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Use of Social Media DFMie</a> for their late-night curation of social media from the manhunt for Boston Marathon bombing suspects.</p>
<div>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes a national story becomes an important local story because everyone is talking about it. And when two reporters stay up all night <a title="The Mercury coverage of Boston Marathon bombing manhunt" href="http://storify.com/mercuryx/the-mercury-s-social-media-efforts-overnight-durin">curating coverage</a>,  it  personalizes that coverage for our readers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The brief nomination included a link to Editor Nancy March&#8217;s blog post, which offered further explanation. The two journalists separately noticed late-night coverage of the unfolding events and quickly started coordinating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Frank and I decided on what to tweet and retweet,” said Moore. “<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/">The Boston Globe</a> and <a href="http://www.ap.org/">The Associated Press</a> are trusted sources; anything else, use caution.  We’re not trying to break anything,” Moore said. “We just thought, ‘Hey maybe if somebody wakes up and has no idea what happened, at least they will know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>From 1:30 to 4:30 a.m., Moore updated the top story on The Mercury website six or seven times. The final version at 4:38 a.m. reported that one of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings was dead after a police shootout and the second was on the run, a massive manhunt under way.</p>
<p>During the same time frame and continuing until about 7:30 a.m., Otto posted <a href="https://twitter.com/MercuryX">@MercuryX</a>, unfolding the story for our readers from news accounts, the police scanner, and other reporting sources.</p>
<p>“It kinda rolls out like a mosaic — you have to sort through it all, and you need context,” Otto said.</p>
<p>Responsibility and accuracy are critical.</p>
<p>“I stayed away from specific addresses or anything that might hurt what was going on,” Otto said.</p>
<p>Both Otto and Moore were careful to avoid rumor and unattributed information. “We’re all about confirming,” Otto said. He sought out known reliable sources, including a reporter on the scene for <a href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/">Digital First Media</a>, The Mercury’s parent company.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; color: #444444; font-size: 1rem;"><a href="http://merceditorsdesk.blogspot.com/2013_04_01_archive.html">J</a>udges&#8217; comments:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Mercury staffers Frank Otto and Steve Moore did an excellent job of triangulating on huge amounts of information while also paying careful attention to accurate sourcing. Otto and Moore did a nice job of dividing the work of managing three different digital platforms while breaking news unfolded. Most impressive is the independent initiative both took during off hours and without an assigning editor.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of two DFMies for The Mercury and one of seven for the Pennsylvania newsrooms.</p>

— Zack Harold (@ZackHarold) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackHarold/statuses/278560719312662528">December 11, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_3306" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/charleston-daily-mail/zack-harold-wins-dfmie-social-media/zack-harold/" rel="attachment wp-att-3306"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3306" alt="Zack Harold" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Zack-Harold-259x300.jpg" width="259" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zack Harold</p></div>
<p><a title="Zack Harold" href="http://muckrack.com/ZackHarold">Zack Harold</a> of the Charleston Daily Mail wins the DFMie for best use of social media for his <a title="Major explosion in Sissonville" href="http://storify.com/zackharold/possible-explosion-in-sissonville">coverage of a pipeline explosion in West Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>His editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zack Harold spearheaded our social media coverage of a gas pipeline explosion on Dec. 11. The pipeline caused a monster fireball that rumbled toward Interstate 77, scorching homes, burning trees, melting cars and making the highway asphalt crumble. As the situation developed, Zack used Storify to compile social media updates from media and residents about what was happening at the scene. The Storify served as a reservoir of breaking news and reaction, and received 4,677 views.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained why this was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zack Harold&#8217;s Storify of the Sissonville explosion is a great example of how journalists can use social media to provide useful information during a breaking news event. Harold showed a great deal of insight into what people would want to know during the event &#8212; where to go for shelter, which roads were closed, reports of any injuries &#8212; and what they might want to know afterwards, like how asphalt actually melted during the gas line explosion. He also guided those who weren&#8217;t familiar with Storify as a tool, by reminding them how to use it along the way. By giving multiple accounts of the accident, gathering pictures from social media, and pulling from the official emergency response messages, he was able to give a well-rounded picture of what was going on in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists in the social media category were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="Jeff Edelstein" href="https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyEdelstein">Jeff Edelstein</a> of The Trentonian for his <a title="Hurricane Sandy engagement by Jeff Edelstein" href="http://storify.com/jeffedelstein/hurricane-sandy-1">Facebook engagement during Hurricane Sandy</a>.</span></li>
<li><a title="Lisa Yanick-Jonaitis" href="https://twitter.com/lisayj_msun">Lisa Yanick-Jonaitis</a> of The Morning Sun in Mt.

</ul>
<p>Harold is a state government reporter for the Charleston Daily Mail in Charleston, W.Va. A native West Virginian, Harold is a 2009 graduate of the University of Charleston, where he studied print journalism, and joined the Daily Mail shortly after completing his degree. He began as the newspaper&#8217;s education reporter, before switching to a general assignment/health beat. In December, he became a member of the Daily Mail&#8217;s statehouse team, where he covers the West Virginia Senate. Harold also writes for the paper&#8217;s state government blog, the <a title="Capitol Notebook" href="http://blogs.dailymail.com/capitolnotebook/">Capitol Notebook</a>, and publishes a weekly email newsletter, <a title="Capitol Notebook Week in Review" href="https://tinyletter.com/CapitolNotebook">The Capitol Notebook Week in Review</a>.</p>

<p><a title="Kim McDaniel" href="http://linkedin.com/in/kimmcdaniel">Kim McDaniel</a> wins the DFMie for special contribution for her digital leadership in the Salt Lake Tribune newsroom.</p>
<p>Editor Nancy Conway explained McDaniel&#8217;s value to the Tribune in her nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kim McDaniel is The Salt Lake Tribune&#8217;s early adopter. Whenever a new wave heads our way, Kim is the one who paddles out to catch it. She&#8217;s been doing it since <a title="Salt Lake Tribune" href="http://www.sltrib.com/">sltrib.com</a> was created in 1995 as one of the first 10 newspaper web sites in the country.</p>
<p>First as a clerk, then as a web producer and now as the leader of our web team, Kim has pushed the newsroom to embrace the speed and the interactivity of the new paradigm. She wrote sltrib.com&#8217;s first online-only column, and later she become our first blogger. She established The Tribune&#8217;s beachheads on <a title="Salt Lake Tribune on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/saltlaketribune">Facebook</a> and <a title="Salt Lake Tribune on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sltrib">Twitter</a> long before each was viewed as indispensible to journalism. We had our <a title="Salt Lake Tribune on Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/sltrib/">Pinterest page</a> up while Pinterest was still in open beta.</p>
<p>More than just a social media addict, Kim truly understands the connective power of the Internet. She has been a steadfast proponent of a &#8220;persistent identity&#8221; comments format, which allows commenters to adopt pseudonyms as long as they stick with them for all comments. It&#8217;s not that radical an idea now, but it was a hard sell back in 2005. When we were getting hit with the usual comments backlash (&#8220;how can you allow such awful things on your site?&#8221;), Kim fought hard to preserve it. She argued, effectively, that the predominant culture in Utah made it trickier for individuals to attach their names to controversial positions. Now, we wouldn&#8217;t do it any other way. In 2012 our comments platform received more than one million comments from more than 42,000 separate commenters. Our site is the undisputed interactive leader among Utah news sites.</p>
<p>And Kim doesn&#8217;t just live it herself. She brings the rest of us along. Part advocate and all trainer, Kim has prodded the newsroom through emails, staff seminars and individual coaching sessions. She has used page-view data to drive discussions about what readers really want vs. what journalists think they should want. She celebrates the stories that people want to read.</p>
<p>More recently she&#8217;s taken her act on the road. She was invited to serve on a social media panel at the Associated Press Sports Editors annual meeting in Chicago last year, and she is currently running a weeklong workshop at DePauw University on all things social for journalists.</p>
<p>For Kim, it&#8217;s all about perpetual curiosity and not being encumbered by the past. She has become a crucial figure in The Salt Lake Tribune&#8217;s evolution and for that she is our nominee for the &#8220;Special Contribution&#8221; DFMie.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained why they chose McDaniel for the award:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kim&#8217;s commitment to The Salt Lake Tribune and keeping it ahead of the curve, always thinking about what&#8217;s next, deserves recognition. Her leadership to help the newsroom embrace speed and interactivity, as well as her interest in comments and reader interaction, have been significant contributions not just to the newsroom but the Salt Lake community. Her always-thinking-about-what&#8217;s-next mentality and embrace of technology is what more newsrooms need in the 21st century.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for the special contribution DFMie were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="MaryJo Webster" href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine">MaryJo Webster</a> of the Pioneer Press, who shared in the DFMies for <a title="Ben Goessling and MaryJo Webster ..." href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/pioneer-press/pioneer-press-homerun-project-wins-data-journalism-dfmie/">data journalism</a> and <a title="Pioneer Press examination ..." href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/pioneer-press-examination-public-pension-spiking-wins-investigative-journalism-dfmie/">investigative journalism</a> and was also a finalist for <a title="LA Riots Project ..." href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/los-angeles-news-group/l-a-riots-project-wins-dfmie-interactive-journalism/">interactive journalism</a>. She is the only winner of two annual DFMies and the only four-time finalist. </span></li>
<li><a title="Brian McCready" href="https://twitter.com/nhrbmccready">Brian McCready</a> of the New Haven Register, who led a makeshift bureau in a hotel in Southbury, Conn., near Newtown to lead on-site coverage of the <a title="Sandy Hook Coverage Shows Scope of Digital First Teamwork" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/02/11/sandy-hook-coverage-shows-scope-digital-teamwork/">massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px">McDaniel joined The Salt Lake Tribune in 1994 as a newsroom assistant. Good timing and a natural curiosity for technology led to writing tech stories and a prominent spot on the small development team for The Tribune&#8217;s first web site. As the internet changed and grew, she became one of the key educators in the newsroom, arming print journalists with the tools to succeed online.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px">When social media emerged, she created and managed accounts for The Tribune, while helping newsroom journalists join and master those platforms, too. Deciding content play, updating layout and design, administrating mobile sites and apps, building SEO and contextual linking, managing social media and reader comments, leading ongoing newsroom education and analyzing analytics and stats are things she touches daily as The Tribune&#8217;s digital director. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px">In the few minutes a day Kim is not online, she&#8217;s traveling with her husband, photographing wildlife, or taking care of her many pets (including Facebook star Mr Fox the Dog).</span></p>

The news stories on our Digital First Media sites have been reported by local journalists, edited by local editors and placed online according to their immediacy and significance.</p>
<p>On the flip side of this, a lot of our readers are increasingly turning toward social media to find their news, using services like <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to surface information they haven&#8217;t seen anywhere else yet. This news may or may not be verified, but it is immediate, it spreads fast and it provides the latest info from all corners of our community and the world in one spot.</p>
<div id="attachment_1016" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/01/09/socialmediawire/screen-shot-2013-01-09-at-3-57-27-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-1016"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1016" alt="Full-Screen Social Media Wire on MercuryNews.com" src="/content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-09-at-3.57.27-PM-300x251.png" width="300" height="251" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Full-Screen Social Media Wire on MercuryNews.com</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s with that in mind that Digital First Media teamed up with Netherlands-based <a href="http://www.crowdynews.com/">CrowdyNews</a> to build the Social Media Wire, a tool that allows readers to quickly browse news from a variety of sources, including social media, without leaving our sites. Using the local knowledge of DFM staff, we can provide relevant, near real-time news about our communities to readers regardless of whether they personally use social media.</p>
<p>Since I joined the company last spring, I&#8217;ve been passionate about this project. You might say I have a bit of history with the Social Media Wire. It actually started as a product idea at <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/encyclo/tbd/?=fromembed">TBD</a>, a local news start-up where I used to work with a few familiar names at DFM (like Jim Brady and Steve Buttry). I was excited to have the opportunity to help build it with CrowdyNews and to help local sites get it off the ground.</p>
<p>Back in August, <a href="http://zombiejournalism.com/2012/08/digital-first-social-media-wire/">we first launched the Social Media Wire</a> on the <a href="http://nhregister.com">New Haven Register</a>&#8216;s site. The local staff in New Haven compiled the RSS feeds of local news sites and blogs and Twitter and YouTube accounts from a variety of community, news and local institutional sources. These streams of information now flow in to Social Media Wire widgets on their <a href="http://nhregister.com">home page</a>, <a href="http://nhregister.com/sports/">section fronts</a>, <a href="http://nhregister.com/articles/2013/01/09/news/doc50ec7d955398d857183503.txt">article pages</a> and a <a href="http://nhregister.com/socialwire">full-screen version</a>.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, the Wire launched to all daily and weekly Journal Register sites, spanning Connecticut, Pennslyvania, Ohio, Michigan and New York. Last week, it made its first appearance in the MediaNews Group at the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/">San Jose Mercury News</a>. Many more DFM sites across the country are set to launch in the coming months.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/01/09/socialmediawire/socialwirex2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1015"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015" alt="Social Media Wire widgets" src="/content/uploads/2013/01/socialwirex2.jpg" width="623" height="281" /></a></p>
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>In these early months of developing the Social Media Wire for each site, we&#8217;ve learned a few things from the page statistics and the observations of our staff:</p>
<p><strong>1. Readers are using this tool to skim the news.</strong> They are clicking between the topic areas in each widget to see the latest news and pausing the streams to see more information. While we may have the Twitter accounts and RSS feeds from our competitors in these streams, our readers aren&#8217;t leaving our site to read these sources from the Social Media Wire. Click-outs from the social streams seem to be pretty small in number so far, meaning that readers are skimming the news, but are not necessarily leaving to read more about it.</p>
<p><strong>2. The sites who put the most work in at the beginning have the best results.</strong> I may travel a lot, but I don&#8217;t know every community as well as its local journalists, so I&#8217;m not the best person to determine what should go into each site&#8217;s Social Media Wire. The journalists who dedicated time to finding and compiling a lot of RSS feeds and social media accounts for local, regional and state-wide news tend to have the best Social Media Wire widgets. Lots of sources mean the stream is always up-to-date, always moving and always has something interesting for the readers.</p>
<p><strong>3. Local topics add local interest.</strong> Aside from the usual news, sports, lifestyle, etc. topics, we can build any kind of topic area into a Social Media Wire widget so long as a local site has enough sources to fuel it. Maybe it&#8217;s a topic specifically for <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/">news from the local university</a>, a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news">staff Twitter list</a>, a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/socialwire">specific sporting event</a>, a <a href="http://www.dfmpolitics.com/">Left/Right breakdown of politics news</a> or a topic especially for outdoors enthusiasts (coming soon on the Colorado sites). If you have an idea, you can build it in no time.</p>
<p><strong>4. The widgets can use a little tweaking over time.</strong> It takes time to know if a local website, blog or Twitter account is really suitable for our streams, sometimes we want to remove accounts or add new ones that pop up. Every site has local control over every stream and widget in the Social Media Wire dashboard to make these edits as they see fit. Also, as CrowdyNews adds new features, we can add new sources to make the streams even more robust.</p>
<p><strong>5. Local feedback matters &#8211; a lot.</strong> CrowdyNews has been extremely helpful in building in new features and fixes suggested by our local journalists over the past few months. If you have a suggestion as to how this tool could work better, let me know. You might see it in the next edition.</p>
<h3>New additions</h3>
<p>Since the Social Media Wire first launched, there have been a lot of changes to improve the experience for readers and our staff, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Instagram and Flickr tags. If your local community uses either of these photo-sharing sites and uses common tags to identify them (like SantaCruz, CMU, Phillies, etc.), we can pull these into our topic streams.</li>
<li>Added support for YouTube playlists (in addition to Youtube accounts).</li>
<li>Added support to include Instagram, YouTube and Twitter updates via location. This could be particularly useful for topics or widgets built for breaking news or specific events.</li>
<li>Ability to add sources in bulk inside the dashboard. Now you can easily add dozens of RSS or social feeds at once. This has been a huge help for me as I have been building each site&#8217;s topics. You&#8217;ll like it, too.</li>
<li>New statistics inside the dashboard showing how and how often readers interact with topics, tweets, videos and RSS items on each widget.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, I&#8217;m here to help. If you have questions or suggestions on the Social Media Wire, let me know either in comments here, <a href="mailto:mjenkins@digitalfirstmedia.com">via email</a> or you know you can always reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mjenkins">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><em><em>A committee of Digital First Media journalists has discussed how journalists should share personal opinions extensively, aided by Advisory Board member <a title="Jay Rosen" href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu">Jay Rosen</a>, who has written frequently about the &#8220;<a title="The view from nowhere: Questions and answers" href="http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">view from nowhere</a>.&#8221; The group recommends these guidelines to help DFM journalists and newsroom leaders in deciding whether, when and how staff members should express, or refrain from expressing, personal opinions.</em></em></p>
<p><em>This is the second in <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2012/12/14/opinion-engagement-social-media/">a series of posts</a> sharing the group&#8217;s advice to Digital First newsrooms, opinion pages and individual journalists. The group members are listed at the end of this post. </em></p>
<h3>Guiding values</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Journalists and newsrooms should seek truth and report it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Opinions are an important part of the journalism we provide for our community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">We must always seek to build trust.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Transparency helps build trust.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Journalists should avoid or disclose conflicts that may shape their reporting or opinions.</p>
<h3>Recommendations<b> </b></h3>
<p>Journalists should avoid statements of advocacy in all platforms except editorials and specifically labeled opinion content. However, advocacy is not the only type of opinion content.</p>
<p>With their editors’ approval and guidance, journalists who are sufficiently knowledgeable about topics should write with authority, which can include analysis, commentary and calling out false statements by politicians and other newsmakers. Journalists who may write with authority should do so in social media and broadcast appearances as well as on our company’s own platforms. Editors should consider whether such content should be labeled in some way to distinguish it from traditional neutral reporting.</p>
<p>A journalist may gain the ability to write with authority as he or she gains experience in the community or on a beat or a particular topic. Or a journalist with authority on a topic might start covering a different topic where he or she is less authoritative. Either the editor or the journalist should initiate discussions about whether the journalist’s level of authority has changed.</p>
<p>Our highest value as journalists and news organizations is to seek truth and report it. This means going beyond the faux balance of <a title="He-said-she-said" href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2009/04/12/hesaid_shesaid.html">he-said-she-said</a> stories to learn, document and state what is true. Once our reporting has established the truth of a situation, future reporting should repeat that truth, especially if newsmakers continue to repeat statements that have been documented as false.</p>
<p>For some staff members and some beats, editors may say journalists should refrain entirely from statements of opinion, either because the topic is so polarizing, because opinions in that area might jeopardize credibility or because the journalist is not ready to write with authority on that topic.</p>
<p>We generally encourage journalists to join debates within our profession on matters such as journalism ethics, innovation and whether and when journalists should express opinions. Statements of advocacy are acceptable in these professional discussions.</p>
<p>For most journalists covering news beats or editing general news, statements of opinion in social media and other platforms about matters of culture such as entertainment or sports are acceptable. Journalists covering those areas should discuss with their editors what level of opinion is acceptable. Conversely, journalists covering areas such as entertainment or sports might be freer than news reporters to express views on politics or local news. All journalists interested in expressing opinions in areas they don’t normally cover should discuss with their editors what is acceptable and what might be troublesome. Part of this discussion should be whether the journalist might cover the topics someday and whether these statements of opinion would jeopardize credibility.</p>
<p>Staff members should always disclose to editors when they have personal involvements or experience that might color their reporting or support a perception of bias. Editors and staff members should discuss whether such potential conflicts are serious enough to warrant reassignment. Where the conflicts are not significant enough to merit reassignment, editors should disclose the journalist’s involvement or experience to readers. Possible ways of disclosure might include an editor’s note or a first-person sidebar.</p>
<p>For staff members who regularly express opinions, we should consider a standing disclosure of experiences and relationships that may influence their views, such as <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/about/disclosures-about-steve-buttry/">Steve Buttry’s disclosure on his blog</a> (which is more detailed than some journalists might need). This disclosure should be linked from the “about” page on a journalist’s blog.</p>
<p>DFM journalists should consider first-person writing in appropriate situations. If a journalist’s personal experience or perspective on a story would add to the reader’s understanding, journalists and/or their editors should suggest such an approach, possibly as a sidebar, a first-person main story, an accompanying video or blog post.</p>
<p>Staff members can and should be <a title="Journalists should be personable but professional in social media" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/journalists-should-be-personable-but-professional-in-social-media-use/">personable in social media</a>, live chats and blogs regardless of what level of opinion is acceptable for them.</p>
<p>When journalists’ work prompts statements of from the public, such as in story comments or on social media, the journalists should engage in the discussion. If it would be inappropriate for the journalist to express opinions, it is still fine to respond in other ways, such as thanking readers for their comments or correcting opinion misstatements of fact.</p>
<p>We encourage discussions between staff members and their editors about when, whether and how journalists should produce commentary, write with authority or otherwise express opinions. One policy does not fit all DFM journalists or fit a particular journalist in every situation.</p>
<p>We encourage training and coaching on such matters as writing with authority, fact-checking and appropriate forms of opinion journalism.</p>
