				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-9.21.28-AM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 9.21.28 AM" /></p><p>An interview with a 6-year-old victim of a drive-by shooting won the January DFMie for the Texas/New Mexico cluster for Taryn Walker of the Carlsbad Current-Argus.</p>
<p>Cluster Editor Bob Moore explained the story in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drive-by shootings are seen as a big city problem, but they occur in small towns, too. When a child was shot in such a crime in Carlsbad, the Current-Argus used Facebook and Twitter to quickly update the community, then followed the story with text and video.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges applauded the result:</p>
<blockquote><p>What a riveting interview with a six-year-old. Little Emma is a voice for the voiceless &#8212; other innocent six-year-olds, on the other side of the country, who were also shot but didn&#8217;t survive to tell their story. Walker clearly succeeded in creating a sense of rapport and trust, so that Emma and her family felt comfortable sharing their experience in front of a camera. No small feat. (p.s. Love the photo.)</p>
<p>In the article, Walker&#8217;s matter-of-fact recounting of the incident added to its impact &#8211; an ordinary sleep turned nightmarish by an out-of-nowhere bullet. (Also: Useful to read that arrests had been made.) It is a great glimpse of the collateral and unintended damage caused by our relationship with firearms. The video was compelling because it shows where the bullet landed in Emma’s room &#8211; and her recount of that night. Seeing and hearing the six-year-old describe what happened physically &#8212; and how it impacted her, emotionally &#8212; was heartbreaking.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other finalists in the Tex/Mex cluster were James Staley of the Las Cruces Sun-News for a story about the boom in concealed-weapon permits and Jenny Kane of the Daily Times in Farmington, N.M., for a story about the <a title="American Indians' child welfare in question in adoptions" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/newmexico/ci_22367955/american-indian-childrens-welfare-question-adoptions">impact of the Indian Child Welfare Act</a> on adoptions of Navajo children.</p>
