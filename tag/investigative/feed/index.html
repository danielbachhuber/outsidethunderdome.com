		<description><![CDATA[Now that our Digital First Represents contestants have completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we're ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents #NICAR14 contest.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p>In September, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/30/nicar14-digital-first-represents/">we kicked off our contest</a> to send three journalists from Digital First Media papers to learn data journalism skills from the best in the business at Investigative Reporters and Editors&#8217; <a title="NICAR 14" href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/" target="_blank">2014 Computer-Assisted Reporting conference</a> in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Today, after our contestants completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we&#8217;re ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents <a title="#NICAR14 on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nicar14" target="_blank">#NICAR14</a> contest.</p>
<p>We received 18 entries from reporters and editors in every cluster of the company. From the Los Angeles Area News Group to New England, enterprising journalists with great ideas threw their hats into the ring.</p>
<p>We expected a lot from the folks who entered this contest. We asked them to jump through hoops that would introduce them to some of the training and support that our company and other journalism organizations can offer.</p>
<p><strong>1. They all had to join our data journalism discussion group</strong>, which now numbers more than 100 members from every DFM state and cluster. (If you&#8217;d like to join the conversation, email data editor Tom Meagher at <a href="mailto: tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>2. Everyone had to complete at least one online class in data journalism</strong>. Many took more than one class. For some, it was an afternoon of <a title="CartoDB Academy" href="http://cartodb.com/academy" target="_blank">interactive mapping with CartoDB</a>. For others, it was a weeks-long <a title="Udacity statistics" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/st101" target="_blank">statistics class from Udacity</a> or an <a title="Introduction to databases" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/db" target="_blank">introduction to databases on Coursera</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. For our judges, though, the most important requirement was that every entrant had to pitch a project</strong> they want to pursue with the skills they hope to learn at NICAR. Because the stories haven&#8217;t run yet, we can&#8217;t tell you too much about the winners&#8217; projects, but rest assured, they will chronicle their reporting process here on InsideThunderdome as their projects develop.</p>
<p>Enough throat clearing. You&#8217;re probably only reading this to find out who won the contest. So who did we decide on? Without further adieu&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Lindsey-Anderson.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6016 alignleft" alt="Lindsey Anderson, Las Cruces Sun-News" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Lindsey-Anderson-150x150.jpg" width="105" height="105" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/L_M_Anderson" target="_blank">Lindsey Anderson</a> </strong>is an education and border reporter at the <a title="Las Cruces Sun-News" href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/" target="_blank">Las Cruces Sun-News</a>. Her favorite stories to cover include issues kids face in southern New Mexico, from teen pregnancy to educational disparities. She graduated from American University in 2012 and has a very expensive travel addiction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/adkins.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-6015 alignright" alt="Sean Adkins, York Daily Record" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/adkins.jpeg" width="77" height="115" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/sadkins75" target="_blank">Sean Adkins</a></strong> is a business reporter with the <a title="York Daily Record" href="http://www.ydr.com/" target="_blank">York Daily Record</a>/Sunday News. Since joining the Daily Record in 2000, he has covered the utility industry, including Three Mile Island and Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, real estate, retail and tourism. His digital and print beat reporting and investigative work has won several awards from the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association.</p>
<p><strong><img class="wp-image-6017 alignleft" alt="Jason Hoppin, Santa Cruz Sentinel" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/photo-11-e1387557418744-150x150.jpg" width="105" height="105" /><a href="https://twitter.com/scnewsdude" target="_blank">Jason Hoppin</a></strong> is a reporter at the <a title="Santa Cruz Sentinel" href="http://santacruzsentinel.com/" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a>, covering the county and the environment in his hometown. Formerly at American Lawyer Media and the <a title="TwinCities.com" href="http://www.twincities.com/" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>, he has covered a number of beats in his career, including crime, state and federal courts, health care, politics and government at all levels. (And he still wants to try his hand at sports).</p>
<p>The winners were selected by our panel of judges, which included data editor <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/" target="_blank">Tom Meagher</a>, interactives editor <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins/" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a> and St. Paul Pioneer Press database editor <a title="MaryJo Webster on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine" target="_blank">MaryJo Webster</a>.</p>
<p>For each of the winners, Digital First Media will pay for the #NICAR14 conference registration and lodging. They (or their newsrooms) have to foot the bill for their travel to Baltimore. In return, the winners have some responsibilities. They will tweet several of the conference sessions. They will write about what they learn at NICAR14 for InsideThunderdome.com. They&#8217;ll also go back to their newsrooms and share their newfound knowledge.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the winners will put their new data skills to immediate use as they pursue significant, data-driven investigative projects in their newsrooms. After those stories run, they&#8217;ll show their work by writing about how they did it for InsideThunderdome.com.</p>
<p>NICAR 14 will be an incredible learning opportunity for these three DFM journalists. It&#8217;s regrettable that we can&#8217;t send more of our colleagues with great data reporting projects in the works as well. But we are confident that we count on Lindsey, Sean and Jason to channel their experience into some really compelling work that we can all learn from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-9.18.06-AM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 9.18.06 AM" /></p><p>Team hustle put the Los Angeles News Group out front in coverage of the sex abuse scandal that engulfed the Los Angeles Archdiocese. The coverage won the January DFMie for the cluster.</p>
<p>Executive Editor Michael Anastasi explained in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Wed., Jan. 23., the Archdiocese of Los Angeles – nation’s largest with 4 million Catholics in Southland – released long-awaited files on sexual-abuse of children by priests. There were 4,000 pages of documents released, and they illustrated the stunning depth to which Cardinal Richard Mahony engaged in cover-up, depravity of crimes committed and pain of victims. We made decision to go for a Sunday special report, and result was a 16-story, 4-page package in print and <a title="Los Angeles Archdiocese kept sexual abuse in the shadows" href="http://www.dailynews.com/ci_22457658">extensive digital package</a> that we did in basically 48 hours. Got good run on local news, and we believe it was instrumental in church deciding to release self-publish 30,000 pages of documents the following week, despite their lawyers’ advice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Team members were Harrison Sheppard, editor; Carolina Garcia, senior editor; Barbara Jones, lead reporter; additional reporters Tracy Manzer, Dana Bartholomew, Susan Abram; and digital editors Daniel Tedford and Daniel Aitken.</p>
<p>The coverage amazed the judges:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wow! The Daily News team has got it going! It&#8217;s on-deadline special report on the Archdiocese of Los Angeles&#8217; horrific sex scandals and coverup distilled 4,000 pages of files on criminal priests who molested children, then were shielded by leaders including Cardinal Mahony. While reporters at the LA Times were still reviewing the documents released by court order, the Daily News crew produced a compelling 16-story section in 48 hours, along with a digital package that prompted officials to release even more documents. Nice work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is an example of how to use the web to organize a TON of information and make it approachable for the average reader. &#8230; This is a solid example of how city/police reporters can very easily use the web to more clearly communicate a complex story. To have the insight to put it together like this amid all of the reporting work is nothing short of impressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote><p>Phenomenal reporting in a short period of time. It&#8217;s obviously a sickening topic, but clear, short articles are more digestible. Using hyperlinks throughout not only increases credibility, but it also involves the reader, letting them dig into the documents. The overall online presentation was solid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists in LANG were team coverage of the <a title="Golden Globes coverage" href="http://live.dailynews.com/Event/Golden_Globes_2013_Live_coverage?Page=0">Golden Globes</a>, <a title="Oscar nominations coverage" href="http://live.dailynews.com/Event/Oscar_Nominations_2013_Reaction">Oscar nominations</a> and <a title="Rose Parade coverage" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/rosebowlparade">Rose Parade</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert Gehrke and Tom Harvey of the Salt Lake Tribune won the January DFMie for the Colorado/Utah cluster for coverage of an unfolding scandal surrounding Utah Attorney General John Swallow.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-9.12.32-AM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 9.12.32 AM" /></p><p>Robert Gehrke and Tom Harvey of the Salt Lake Tribune won the January DFMie for the Colorado/Utah cluster for coverage of an unfolding scandal surrounding Utah Attorney General John Swallow.</p>
<p>Editor Nancy Conway explained in her nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Salt Lake Tribune broke a major story in early January that continues to erupt. A Utah businessman Jeremy Johnson, indicted for fraud &#8212; himself <a title="Indicted businessman: Utah A.G. tied to alleged scheme" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home3/55598812-200/johnson-swallow-rawle-attorney.html.csp">accuses Utah&#8217;s new Attorney General, John Swallow</a>, of brokering a bribery deal to buy influence from U.S. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada. Swallow has vigorously denied wrongdoing, and Reid has denied any connection at all. Subsequent Tribune stories have added specific details about the connection between Johnson and Swallow and a <a title="Money trail led to a friend of Reid" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/55679923-79/rawle-swallow-johnson-works.html.csp">money trail to a friend of Reid</a>.</p>
<p>The stories have created an uproar in the state. Utah&#8217;s political establishment is distancing itself from Swallow, and in an unusual move, the U.S. Justice Department has acknowledged it is investigating Swallow. Many individuals and groups have called for Swallow&#8217;s resignation and the state legislature is proposing new ethics  legislation.</p>
<p>Now The Tribune&#8217;s investigation has <a title="Utah attorney general scandal spreads ..." href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/55818990-90/swallow-shurtleff-attorney-johnson.html.csp">spread to Swallow&#8217;s predecessor, former Attorney General Mark Shurtleff</a>, with allegations that both men were approaching companies for political donations in exchange for protection from prosecution.</p>
<p>All told, the stories have drawn more than a million page views and many thousands of comments. At one point early in the process of covering the story, Shurtleff, the former AG tweeted that Tribune reporters were guilty of breaking journalistic ethics by holding the story until after the election. Reporters in turn, via tweets, directed the AG to an <a title="Editor's column ..." href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/55662231-78/johnson-harvey-source-accusations.html.csp">editor&#8217;s column</a> &#8212; that in an effort to be transparent &#8212; was posted that same day and explored how coverage decisions were made and how the investigation was being managed. The story continues to grow.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/sltrib">sltrib</a>, @<a href="https://twitter.com/robertgehrke">robertgehrke</a> &amp; @<a href="https://twitter.com/tomharvey">tomharvey</a> violated journalistic ethics in deal w/ indicted fraudster to hold Swallow story until Jan. court date.</p>
<p>— Mark L. Shurtleff (@MarkShurtleff) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkShurtleff/status/292678379294060544">January 19, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/markshurtleff">markshurtleff</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/intorainbowz">intorainbowz</a> It would have been unethical to run the story earlier than we did. <a title="http://bit.ly/10qMck4" href="http://t.co/heSWtNIT">bit.ly/10qMck4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23utpol">#utpol</a></p>
<p>— RobertGehrke (@RobertGehrke) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertGehrke/status/292706286477385730">January 19, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judges praised the aggressive reporting:</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought the reporters did a great job of making a complex-story very readable. The stories were well-sourced, backed up with appropriate documentation and written in a way that made me want to keep reading more about this scandal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tom Harvey and Robert Gehrke have done a fine job of holding public officials accountable with this series of stories. It is difficult to build a story off of the account of a man who was indicted for fraud but both Harvey and Gehrke managed to take the information provided by Johnson and, through dogged reporting, unravel various layers that show readers the importance of transparency in government. The public benefits when the work of a newspaper gets a state to consider stronger ethics legislation. Their work speaks to the necessity of having an open government and the need for more watchdog reporting.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stories that follow the money trail are classic journalism. The reporters at the Salt Lake Tribune carefully unraveled letters, recorded discussions, and documents to reveal the messiness of running a campaign and what happens when the wrong people are involved. I also chose this series because the lede on the second story: &#8220;Does Deathbed Declaration Help or Hurt Swallow,&#8221; was strong and compelling. Overall, the story drew a lot of readers&#8217; comments proving that the community felt engaged in this series. In addition, the online versions included links within the story for readers, as well as a list of stories and the actual documents.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Viktoria &#8230; obtained the employment contract of every public school superintendent in Connecticut through Freedom of Information Act requests and then <a title="How We Did It: Connecticut Superintendents Salary Map and Database" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/01/11/it-connecticut-superintendents-salary-map-database/">worked with the new data team at Thunderdome</a> to build a searchable, interactive database showing salary and benefits trends by town/region, with links to every contract. Here’s Vik’s <a title="Connecticut school superintendents project" href="http://bit.ly/103ME8J">summary of the project</a>.</p>
<p>She wrote numerous stories analyzing the data, and even customized articles for each of our publications across the state. Early in the process, she also wrote articles rating the school districts on how quickly they responded to the FOIA requests and whether they made it difficult, i.e., by asking why we wanted the contracts or charging for copies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges loved the watchdog aspect of the project and the enterprise it showed:</p>
<blockquote><p>An ambitious undertaking to catalogue the salaries of school superintendents across Connecticut employing FOIA requests. The map gives an easy, quick scan of the state then is clickable to go deeper into the data. Readers should find this information useful and easily accessible. Hopefully the investigative team will continue to build on this data by adding information on average teacher salaries, student performance on standardized tests and growth or declines in graduation rates, which can help evaluate whether a superintendent is worth the pricetag.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge added:</p>
<blockquote><p>With all the country-wide &#8212; largely misplaced &#8212; rage against teacher&#8217;s unions; a cold hard look at the top &#8220;administrator&#8221; is a welcomed, and eye-opening counterbalance.</p>
<p>Especially like the cost per student column: $672 per student? That&#8217;s a ridiculous, and useless, expenditure toward &#8220;education.&#8221; You could buy an iPad and more for each student in that district. Comes close to the &#8220;afflict the comfortable&#8221; mission of true journalism.</p>
<p>The integration code (between map an table) being worked on will be a useful and welcomed tool; can&#8217;t wait for more database stories. This changes dry figures into an essential story that affects every parent, student and taxpayer in Connecticut.</p></blockquote>

His investigative reporting for the Marin Independent-Journal helped reveal that many local residents were paying property taxes for land owned by other people. Local counties and school districts are investigating more than 1,858 tax bills for 1,858 mobile home and houseboat owners with parcel tax charges have been <a href="http://www.marinij.com/ci_22132264">flagged for review</a>. This variety of public service investigative journalism directly improves people&#8217;s lives and definitely deserves a DFMie.</p>
<p>As one judge noted,</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The research was airtight and the thorny issue was presented in a clear, concise way. This is a real scoop &#8211; something that might not have seen the light of day if not for hard work from a journalist. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 2/18 </strong>Following the Independent-Journal&#8217;s publication of the story, officials were set scrambling to <a href="http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_22550782/600-marin-houseboat-and-mobile-homeowners-share-500">refund $500,000 in tax payments</a> erroneously collected by county agencies.</p>
<p>As one reader wrote in an email to Nels,</p>
<blockquote><p>On behalf of all the mobile home owners and I&#8217;m sure the floating home residents, thank you for following through with this story and making it happen. It&#8217;s really a big deal in terms of the money that has to be refunded.</p></blockquote>

Brown interviewed more than 60 water officials, scientists, utility customers and others to provide a deep look inside the financial, environmental and political implications of the city&#8217;s plan.</p>
<p>The amount of time Brown spent learning about the issue was readily evident throughout the package; it was clear the journalism was produced from a position of knowledge and authority. Complimented by a four-part video series and a live chat, Brown&#8217;s coverage was accessible to readers with varying amounts of background knowledge, as he also produced an easy-to-read &#8216;What we found&#8217; breakout feature to accompany the package.</p>

Such has been the case for the El Paso Times since the city announced its intention to buy the newspaper’s building. The purchase is part of a broader controversial effort to demolish City Hall to clear the way for a Triple A baseball stadium.</p>
<p>As the City Council was preparing to finalize the purchase of the Times building for $14 million, El Paso Times journalists obtained the city’s appraisal of the building and discovered the appraised value was $3.7 million below the purchase price. In a stunning display of incompetence, city officials hadn’t really read the appraisal until Times reporter Marty Schladen started asking about it. Although the discovery risked costing the company several million dollars, the Times broke the story and has continued to follow the issue. Almost a month later, the fate of the sale is still uncertain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salt Lake Tribune reporter Julia Lyon heard more than a year ago that some Utah families, desperate for care for their children with autism, were surrendering custody to the state. (Utah is in a minority of states without a mandate that insurance companies cover treatment.)</p>
<p>She spent months reporting, starting with the challenge of locating families willing to tell their stories and give her access to to their child welfare files. Her compelling stories, with photography by Trent Nelson, introduce readers to two young boys surrendered by their families and illuminate the impact of a lack of affordable care.</p>
