				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-07-at-10.52.08-AM-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-07 at 10.52.08 AM" /></p><p>Digital First Media was the first news organization to build a national database for analyzing premium costs on the health insurance exchanges set up as a result of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>This unique analysis <a href="http://www.twincities.com/nation/ci_25247140/where-insurance-premiums-are-highest-new-health-laws" target="_blank">shed light on how tax credits are making premium costs more affordable</a>, but that large disparities remain in how much consumers will actually pay simply as a result of where they live. The story, by senior data reporter<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwebster" target="_blank"> MaryJo Webster</a> and St. Paul Pioneer Press health care reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissnowbeck" target="_blank">Chris Snowbeck</a>, and the interactive map, by DFM news apps developer <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/vhagery" target="_blank">Vaughn Hagerty</a>, published Feb. 28.</p>
<p>Here’s some insight into how we did it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you think this was worth pursuing?<br />
</strong><em></em></p>
<div id="attachment_7096" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/cst_Chris_Snowbeck_1_.jpeg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-7096" alt="Chris Snowbeck, St. Paul Pioneer Press" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/cst_Chris_Snowbeck_1_-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chris Snowbeck, St. Paul Pioneer Press</p></div>
<p><em>Chris Snowbeck</em>: In covering the launch of the Minnesota exchange, we found there were significant premium disparities between the Twin Cities, Rochester, Minn., and nearby western Wisconsin. He compared the &#8220;benchmark&#8221; premium — a 50-year-old, non-smoker, buying the second-lowest-cost silver tier policy — to the same figures for the states in the federal exchange. That comparison showed the rating area encompassing the Twin Cities had the lowest premiums, while Rochester and an area of western Wisconsin just a short drive from St. Paul were both among the highest.</p>
<p>This raised two big questions that could only be answered with a complete national dataset: Would this hold true if we looked at the entire United States? And who would get the &#8220;better deal&#8221; — the consumer in the Twin Cities with low premiums and little chance of getting a federal tax credit, or the consumer in the higher-cost places that will benefit from the subsidies?</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you collect the data?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_6794" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/MaryJo-Webster_avatar_1391182151-300x300.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6794" alt="MaryJo Webster" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/MaryJo-Webster_avatar_1391182151-300x300-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">MaryJo Webster, Digital First Media</p></div>
<p><strong></strong><em>MaryJo Webster:</em> The data for the states in the federal exchange was nicely packaged in an Excel file that the Department of Health and Human Services had posted online. Collecting data for the 15 states that run their own exchanges was a bit harder. Once we figured out the correct terminology when making our request, this wasn’t as hard as we first suspected. Numerous public relations officials told us others had been requesting the same data. In some states, we had to go to the agency that regulates insurance; in other places, we got the information from the exchange.</p>
<p>We didn’t have to file official public records requests; there were a couple states that simply asked for a written request, though. A surprising number of states had this information on their website (although, not always easy to find).</p>
<p><strong>Q: What did you ask for?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: We decided to request, at minimum, the same thing that had been provided in the data for the federal exchange. That data showed the lowest-cost premium for each metal tier (bronze, silver, gold, platinum), in each rating area for individual consumers (not families and not those getting insurance through their employer). In most cases, we obtained a base rate and used age multiplier tables — also provided by the states — to calculate the premiums at each of the 45 age points used by the exchanges. We also made sure to get the second lowest-cost silver premium for each age and rating area. This is used as part of the calculation to determine how much tax credit a consumer would get. Several states gave us premiums for every product available on their exchanges, and we pulled out the lowest-cost for each metal tier and the second lowest-cost silver premium. The hardest part of all this was that most of the data from the state-run exchanges came in PDFs that had to be dumped out to Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you analyze this data?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: Our goal was to determine what people at various ages, income levels and geographies would pay for health insurance premiums after federal tax credits were applied for those eligible. For individuals, the general rule is that you would be eligible for a tax credit if your income is at or below 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold. In the contiguous United States, that amounts to about $45,960 per year (it’s higher in Alaska and Hawaii). With such a massive amount of data, we knew we had to focus at least a little. So we chose to look at how the premiums and tax credits would play out for consumers buying the lowest-cost silver plan available to them. We chose the silver tier because enrollment data in the federal exchange show 60 percent of consumers are choosing silver tier plans.</p>
<p>We ran calculations to estimate the tax credit and ultimate consumer cost (plus what percentage of their income that would be) for people at key income points between 200 and 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold. We also calculated cost as a percentage of income at 401 percent of poverty, and other income levels that are above the threshold for tax credit eligibility.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What difficulties did you encounter?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: Initially, we were told that the tax credit calculation relied on the second lowest-cost silver plan for the rating area. Later after completing data collection, we found out there are places where there are different second lowest-cost silvers within a rating area. Typically, this is a case where one or more insurance plans are only offered in certain counties within the rating area.</p>
<p>We decided to stick with running our tax credit calculations at the rating area level, partly because there aren’t too many places where there are differences within a rating area, and the ones that do exist typically have premium variations of less than $25 per month.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The project includes an interactive map comparing costs in the 501 rating areas across the U.S. How did you decide what to include?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Webster</em>: The map does not include all of our data points; instead it allows users to compare costs for certain ages at key income levels. We figured putting all of the data into the interactive would be a little overwhelming and unnecessary. The goal is to show the general trends, not to provide specific costs for every scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What technology did you use to make the interactive map?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_7097" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Vaughn-Hagerty_avatar_1380631225-300x300.jpeg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-7097" alt="Vaughn Hagerty, Digital First Media" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Vaughn-Hagerty_avatar_1380631225-300x300-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Vaughn Hagerty, Digital First Media</p></div>
<p><em>Vaughn Hagerty:</em> The foundation for the interactive is Google maps and custom JavaScript. A key challenge for this interactive was to manage the amount of data involved: We didn’t want to have files so large that they’d make the app too slow to load or balky.</p>
<p>To create the shapes of the rating areas, we used ArcGIS to dissolve county-level maps (or in some cases, ZIP-code or city-level maps) and then stitch all of those back together into a national shapefile. Then we converted the shapefile to KML (Keyhole Markup Language, a geography-specific XML variant), and used PHP to pare that down into much smaller JavaScript files. The rating data also was converted to a JavaScript format aimed at minimizing file size for more than 35,000 records.</p>
<p>We had two goals for the app: Show some specific examples that illustrate how rates vary and allow users to explore the overall map to see variations nationwide or for specific regions.</p>
<p>For the first we created a “tour” that guided people through a number of examples throughout the country. For the second, we built tools to let people filter the data by certain age and income groups to see how those affect costs. We grouped those costs into four “buckets,” ranges that determined what color the rating area would be on the map for certain age and income criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What should we expect next year when consumers are shopping for 2015 insurance coverage?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Snowbeck</em>: Experts told us some of these disparities might be a quirk that’s simply the result of this being the first year. Insurance companies might have set premiums higher or lower than usual because of uncertainty about who would purchase plans through these exchanges. As a result, it’s quite likely that we’ll see an entirely different picture at the end of this year when rates are set for 2015 insurance policies.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[As Digital First Media works to “unbolt” our newsrooms from print processes and culture, we need a vision of the “unbolted” newsroom. Steve Buttry outlines the six core characteristics.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="project_unbolt-logo" /></p><p>As Digital First Media works to <a title="Here’s how Digital First Media’s Project Unbolt will work" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/">“unbolt” our newsrooms from print processes and culture</a>, we need a vision of the “unbolted” newsroom.</p>
<p>This post will elaborate on the characteristics of an unbolted newsroom, the goal of Project Unbolt, which <a title="Project Unbolt" href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/project_unbolt/">DFM announced</a> yesterday, following <a title="Now what?" href="http://jxpaton.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/now-what/">John Paton&#8217;s first public mention of the project</a> last week.</p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s post, I <a title="Here’s how Digital First Media’s Project Unbolt will work" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">described this newsroom</a> generally, saying it will change in six characteristics (not listed in any particular order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Coverage and storytelling</li>
<li>Processes</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Planning and management</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Standards</li>
</ol>
<p>Here I&#8217;ll describe in some depth how the unbolted newsroom works and thinks in each of these respects. How newsrooms will achieve each of these priorities will vary according to a variety of circumstances such as size, clusterwide operations and the creativity and talents of local staff. The issues and techniques listed here are not exhaustive and do not preclude local newsrooms from pursuing digital priorities not spelled out here.</p>
<p>I welcome suggestions about points I&#8217;ve omitted here or better ways to make my points. I&#8217;ll update as I get suggestions. Leave your suggestions in the comments below.</p>
<h2>1. Coverage and Storytelling</h2>
<h3>Live</h3>
<p>Virtually all event coverage and breaking news coverage are handled as live coverage, with <a title="ScribbleLive" href="http://scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a>, <a title="Suggestions (but not standards) for live tweeting" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/suggestions-but-not-standards-for-live-tweeting/" target="_blank">livetweeting</a>, livestreaming, etc. This includes sports events, government meetings, trials, community festivals, etc.</p>
<p>Live coverage is routine for the unbolted newsroom. Reporters and/or visual journalists covering events plan for live coverage unless they have a good reason not to (a judge won’t allow phones or computers in a courtroom; a family would rather not have you livetweet a funeral; connectivity at a site is poor).</p>
<h3>Timely</h3>
<p>Digital platforms feature fresh news every morning. Breaking news, fresh content and event coverage are posted during the day when they are timely. Evening tablet edition includes fresh content.</p>
<p>Instead of shooting for the deadlines of a morning newspaper, the newsroom strives to post accurate stories (text, video, interactive) quickly to digital platforms. This applies not just to breaking news and events but to other daily news stories: We strive when possible to publish during the workday when our audience is the strongest.</p>
<h3>Enterprise</h3>
<p>The biggest and best enterprise stories are planned as digital packages with elements such as video, interactive graphics and databases, published at optimal times for digital audience (perhaps not all at once).</p>
<p>We don’t publish these stories digitally on Sundays or Saturdays, but publish sometime during the week, with a print version publishing Sunday after digital publication. Publication might stretch over multiple days, starting Wednesday or Thursday with 2-3 days of new digital content, followed by a Sunday print story, followed by a live chat Monday. Sunday stories reviewing a week’s big news story publish digitally before noon on Friday, unless new developments Friday morning demand the reporter’s attention for timely digital posting.</p>
<p>We may not develop a single standard way to publish enterprise content, but possibly multiple standard approaches and occasional special methods. Our efforts to refine our processes for enterprise stories will be guided by digital tools and opportunities and a sense of experimentation, rather than by our need to fill the Sunday newspaper.</p>
<h3>Opinion</h3>
<p>Opinion content is a mix of editorials, columns, cartoons, staff blogs, community blogs, live chats, videos and other interactive content. We need to lead the community conversation, as we always have through our editorial pages. But we need to develop that leadership more aggressively and creatively using digital tools. And we need to join, stimulate and curate the other conversations going on in the community.</p>
<h3>Beat blogs</h3>
<p>Reporters work primarily in <a title="13 ways a reporter should use a beat blog" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/13-ways-a-reporter-should-use-a-beat-blog/" target="_blank">beat blogs</a>, publishing content for niche audiences, freed from the deadlines, space considerations and story structure of the print product. Blog posts will be promoted from the home page, on section fronts and social media as warranted. Reporters and/or editors will edit blog posts for publication in print products as needed.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The newsroom develops data skills – both specialists and basic data skills throughout the newsroom. The unbolted newsroom experiments with ways to use data for journalism, <a title="Be the Answer: Using interactive databases to provide answers and generate revenue" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/be-the-answer-using-interactive-databases-to-provide-answers-and-generate-revenue/" target="_blank">interactive databases</a>, data visualization and structuring and updating archival content for continuing value.</p>
<h3>Photos</h3>
<p>Reporters and visual journalists file photos quickly from breaking news scenes and events. Newsroom regularly solicits and curates photos from community. Visual journalists produce frequent Media Center photo galleries.</p>
<h3>Video</h3>
<p>Reporters and video journalists produce and quickly post Touts with most stories. Newsroom livestreams important events and breaking stories. Newsroom produces frequent webcasts. Newsroom solicits and curates community videos. Visual journalists produce storytelling videos with big stories.</p>
<h3>Interactive</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom experiments with storytelling and curation tools to make stories more interactive with quizzes, interactive databases, maps, polls, timelines and other features that help users experience stories, rather than simply reading or watching them.</p>
<p>Journalists master the tools that prove useful for frequent jobs, but are continually experimenting with new tools and techniques.</p>
<h1>2. Processes</h1>
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>Newsroom workflow focuses on production of content first and primarily for digital platforms. While content management systems dictate parts of workflow, newsroom works with CMS developers to improve the workflow.</p>
<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<p>Daily stories that are not breaking stories or events being covered live get deadlines based on digital needs: maybe 11:30 a.m. if possible to catch the lunch-hour readers or 3:30 if possible to make an evening tablet edition. Late-afternoon or evening deadlines are only for events happening then.</p>
<h3>Editing</h3>
<p>Editing time and energy are focused on ensuring and improving quality of content before (or quickly after) digital publication.</p>
<p>An exception might be reassignment of one or more editor in a new version of the old “rewrite” role, rewriting print stories from live event coverage so that in some cases, the reporter covering an event doesn’t ever write a “story,” but might produce lots of tweets, Touts and other updates that feed a liveblog, and an editor crafts some of that into the print story. (The rewrite role might live in the regional production hub, rather than in the local newsroom.)</p>
<h3>Headlines</h3>
<p>Reporters and local editors write strong SEO headlines for content. As needed, editors in local newsrooms and production hubs edit those headlines for print.</p>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>The newsroom promotes local stories and Thunderdome&#8217;s national content (localized where appropriate) on social media. Reporters, visual journalists and/or editors write conversational posts for Facebook, Twitter and Google+, posting images where appropriate. Visual content is also posted frequently to Tout, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and other relevant social media.</p>
<h3>Print production</h3>
<p>As much as the content management system allows, print production will be limited significantly to the production hub. Local involvement will be minimized, perhaps to designating content for page one and section fronts and reviewing pages before publication.</p>
<h1>3. Engagement</h1>
<h3><b></b>Transparency</h3>
<p>The editor explains newsroom decisions and developments regularly in a blog, social media and community appearances. The staff are encouraged to share the “story behind the story” in social media and blogs as well as community appearances.</p>
<p>Where time permits, newsroom invites community input before and during news coverage. The newsroom engages regularly with the community in person by such means as a community editorial board, community meetings, posting of daily budgets and open and/or livestreamed planning meetings.</p>
<p>The newsroom discloses potential conflicts — personal or business connections with the people and organizations covered.</p>
<h3>Conversation</h3>
<p>Branded social media accounts and individual journalists’ social media accounts have a conversational tone that engages the community as well as promoting digital content. Crowdsourcing and curation are part of the daily routine, asking the community about stories and harvesting content created by the community.<b></b></p>
<h3><b></b>Social media</h3>
<p>Everyone in the newsroom is active on social media, including at least Twitter, Facebook, Tout and Google+, using them and other tools such as Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Foursquare for gathering news, engaging the community, reporting news and posting links to digital content.</p>
<h3>Curation</h3>
<p>The newsroom regularly curates content from the community from blogs, social media and news releases, from organizations and people in the community telling their own stories and from other professional media.</p>
<h3>Hangout</h3>
<p>When possible and when sources are willing, journalists use Hangout rather than telephone for interviews with people they can’t meet in person, using YouTube to livecast and record the interview for use on digital platforms. The newsroom uses Hangout/YouTube (or other video tools) regularly for livecasts with journalists in the field.</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>The newsroom has an active network of community blogs and community social media accounts which are promoted on the digital news products and engaged with the newsroom in various products. Newsroom staffers regularly recruit new members to the network. The newsroom experiments with different ways of curating content from the network. The newsroom engages in person with network members through <a title="Heritage Media teaches media skills in Michigan communities" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/heritage-media-teaches-media-skills-in-michigan-communities/" target="_blank">training</a> and other events and through <a title="Pottstown Mercury engages bloggers in community food drive" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/pottstown-mercury-engages-bloggers-in-community-food-drive/" target="_blank">collaboration on community projects.</a></p>
<h3>Other engagement<b> </b></h3>
<p>The newsroom has strong community engagement, involving a combination of events, outreach, contests and in-person engagement by inviting the community into the newsroom and by engaging out in the community. Staff members engage with comments about their work on the website and in social media.</p>
<h1>4. Planning and management</h1>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>The daily <a title="Advice for editors: Lead Digital First meetings" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/advice-for-editors-lead-digital-first-meetings/" target="_blank">planning meeting</a>, if any, is in the morning, focused on the day’s news coverage plans, early traffic and engagement, stressing the need for early posting and frequent updates for unfolding stories. The morning meeting does not focus on the morning newspaper.</p>
<p>If the newsroom has an afternoon meeting, it reviews the day’s digital coverage and looks ahead to evening event coverage and the morning newspaper as well as news that&#8217;s expected the next day. This should be a smaller meeting but probably can be handled with the print editor conferring individually with the appropriate people.</p>
<p>Enterprise meetings plan interactive elements, video, data and other content that will require significant planning.</p>
<h3>News budgets</h3>
<p>Daily and long-term news budgets list digital coverage tools and techniques that stories will use and list live coverage plans and deadlines for posting initial takes of unfolding stories.</p>
<h3>Staffing</h3>
<p>More staff specialists focus on digital duties such as mobile, social media, data visualization and interactive graphics than on print duties such as page design and print graphics (allowing for the skewed regional duties of a newsroom serving as a regional print hub.)</p>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom uses digital metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of content and engagement and to provide more relevant, engaging content and experiences. All staff members have access to metrics and know how their performance will be measured. The newsroom works to refine and improve its use and understanding of metrics.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>The newsroom works closely with sales and technology colleagues to ensure opportunities to develop effective products and maximize revenue without jeopardizing editorial integrity.</p>
<h3>Staff development</h3>
<p>Each staff member has a personal digital plan, worked out with his or her supervisor and the top editor, and is held accountable for following the plan for personal digital growth.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Editors place a high priority on training in staff time and in budgeting. Staff members who have mastered important skills or experimented with new tools train their colleagues. The newsroom participates in DFM training opportunities such as webinars, <a title="Slides and links for Northern California engagement workshops" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/12/07/slides-and-links-for-northern-california-engagement-workshops/" target="_blank">regional workshops</a> and competition for DFM slots at national conferences.</p>
<p>Editors and staff members watch for external training opportunities, such as state press association conferences, seminars offered by national organizations such as <a title="The Poynter Institute" href="http://poynter.org" target="_blank">Poynter</a> or the <a title="Knight Digital Media Center" href="http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/">Knight Digital Media Center</a> or online training such as courses offered by <a title="News University" href="http://www.newsu.org/" target="_blank">News University</a> or <a title="Lynda" href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda</a>.</p>
<p>The newsroom shares training opportunities with members of its community network.</p>
<h1>5. Mobile</h1>
<h3>Use of mobile tools</h3>
<p>Editors and staff in the unbolted newsroom routinely use mobile tools in their work and in personal news consumption. Most of staff routinely uses newsroom’s app and/or m-dot site.</p>
<h3>Planning and monitoring</h3>
<p>In daily planning meetings, editors check and discuss presentation of content on various mobile platforms and tools. Planning always includes mobile platforms.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>The newsroom has a designated mobile leader and the top editor places a high priority on mobile.</p>
<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>Engagement efforts deliberately seek to invite participation on mobile devices. Contests and conversations explicitly invite engagement on mobile devices at community events.</p>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<p>The newsroom develops mobile and/or community apps for coverage of special events or major community issues or interests.</p>
<h3>Mobile products</h3>
<p>Newsroom offers products to engage and inform the community routinely on mobile devices, such as customized text and/or email alerts, email newsletters and tools that facilitate community reporting.</p>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>Editors follow mobile metrics closely, using their analysis to improve coverage and deliver content that engages and interests the community.</p>
<h3>News gathering</h3>
<p>Staff members use mobile tools routinely to gather content and report from the field.<b> </b></p>
<h1>6. Standards</h1>
<h3><b>Accuracy </b></h3>
<p>Our content must be accurate. Journalists should verify facts before publication in social media or any of our own platforms. We must say how we know what we know and we must say what we don’t know. Staff are trained in verification of information gathered from the community from social media and other platforms.</p>
<p>The newsroom should have an accuracy checklist and expect journalists to use it to prevent errors.</p>
<h3>Corrections</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom corrects all errors that editors or staff members become aware of. Every story should have a link to a form readers can use to notify the newsroom of errors. The newsroom corrects errors in stories and adds notes saying the story (or other content) has been corrected and what the error was (unless the error was potentially defamatory). The newsroom should also publish all corrections in one place that is easily found in website navigation.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>The newsroom should have an updated code of ethics and should regularly discuss ethics and how to apply ethical standards in new situations the staff might face.</p>
<h3>Attribution</h3>
<p>The unbolted newsroom names and links to all digital sources of information, including the competition, even if linking is not easy in the content management system. Where possible, journalists should embed digital content, rather than quoting it. Stories should link to or embed source documents.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>Editors should model and uphold strong ethical standards while leading newsroom conversations about how to make ethical decisions in new processes and circumstances.</p>
<h3>Social media</h3>
<p>Journalists should be personable and professional in interactions with the public, including on social media.</p>
<h3>Accountability</h3>
<p>Managers and staff members have digital goals and their performance is primarily measured by and rewarded for digital achievement.</p>
<h1>Project Unbolt blog</h1>
<p>I will be blogging about the work of <a href="http://www.projectunbolt.com" target="_blank">Project Unbolt here on InsideThunderdome</a>, crossposting to <a title="The Buttry Diary" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com" target="_blank">The Buttry Diary</a>, my personal blog.</p>
<p>Editors and staff members of the pilot newsrooms for Project Unbolt (<a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a>, <a title="Berkshire Eagle" href="http://berkshireeagle.com" target="_blank">Berkshire Eagle</a>, <a title="El Paso Times" href="http://elpasotimes.com" target="_blank">El Paso Times</a> and <a title="News-Herald" href="http://news-herald.com" target="_blank">News-Herald</a>) will also be blogging about the project as they learn lessons from their successes and mistakes.</p>
<p>We also invite our Digital First colleagues to blog about your unbolting efforts. Other newsrooms won&#8217;t get my attention initially at the same level as the pilot newsrooms, but we&#8217;re not expecting them to be spectators in the unbolting process. Let me know — <a href="mailto: sbuttry@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">sbuttry@digitalfirstmedia.com</a> — if you&#8217;d like to blog about your unbolting efforts.</p>
<h1>What do you think?</h1>
<p>We also invite guest posts offering advice and observations about the unbolting process from journalists outside our company or from people in the communities we serve. Contact me if you&#8217;re interested in contributing.</p>
<p>Disagreements are welcome here, too. If you think we should change our unbolting priorities or if you think we&#8217;re going about it wrong or trying some things that won&#8217;t work, feel free to suggest a guest post.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested, though, in guest posts advocating a more cautious path. You are welcome to express nostalgia or fret about the decline of print in the comments. But Project Unbolt is about moving forward and that&#8217;s what the blog will be about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/NEW_paula_pasche-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Paula Pasche" /></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Readers of Michigan&#8217;s Digital First Media newspapers have known for years that they could count on reporter Paula Pasche for in-depth and timely coverage of the Detroit Lions.</span></p>
<p>In addition to her reporting, <a href="http://oplions.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blogging</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/paulapasche" target="_blank">tweeting</a> for news outlets including <a href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/" target="_blank">The Oakland Press</a>, Pasche has authored a book on the Lions, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Lions-Fans-Should-Before/dp/1600787290/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389067465&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=100+things+lions+fans+should+know+%26+do+before+they+die" target="_blank">100 Things Lions Fans Should Know &amp; Do Before They Die</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now readers across <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-serve/" target="_blank">the entire Digital First Media landscape</a> know her for her NFL prediction powers as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_6268" style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-6268" alt="Paula Pasche" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/paula_pasche.jpg" width="160" height="199" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paula Pasche</p></div>
<p>Pasche and five other writers <a title="DFM writers tackle football season with interactive features and insight" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/13/dfm-football-2013-features/" target="_blank">put their reputations on the line each week this season</a>, predicting the outcomes of each NFL game in our <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/national-sports-news/ci_24796405/week-17-nfl-picks-can-you-outdo-our" target="_blank">NFL Experts&#8217; Picks feature</a>. Pasche surged to the front early in the 17-week season, going 12-4 in Week One, and was never overtaken in her wire-to-wire victory.</p>
<p>Pasche finished with a record of 172-83 (.675), beating out <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeOGorman" target="_blank">George O&#8217;Gorman of the Trentonian</a> (170-85, .667) by two correct picks.</p>
<p>For comparison, Pasche would have beaten 12 of the 13 experts on <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/picks/_/week/17/seasontype/2" target="_blank">ESPN&#8217;s panel</a>, with only Ron Jaworski (174-81, .682) managing a record better than Pasche. She also would have beaten all eight of the human experts at <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/features/writers/expert/picks/straight-up/17" target="_blank">CBSSports.com</a>, and tied for first among the eight experts at <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/01/03/staff-picks-wild-card-playoffs-2013-awards/4305917/" target="_blank">USATODAY.com</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My &#8216;secret formula&#8217; involved looking at the spread, the home team, and then going mostly with my gut. And, of course, a lot of luck,&#8221; Pasche said.</p>
<p>All six of the DFM writers also contributed a &#8220;Lock of the Week&#8221; in Tout video form, with Pasche relying on her <a href="http://www.tout.com/m/gf1m2i" target="_blank">magic apple tree</a> as inspiration for many of her sure-fire bets.</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/gf1m2i" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Our other four prognosticators were <a href="https://twitter.com/MercPurdy" target="_blank">Mark Purdy</a> of the San Jose Mercury News, <a href="https://twitter.com/BobGrotz" target="_blank">Bob Grotz</a> of the Delaware County Daily Times, <a href="https://twitter.com/jsbrownsinsider" target="_blank">Jeff Schudel</a> of the northern Ohio News-Herald and <a href="https://twitter.com/merganser10" target="_blank">Dave Pevear</a> of the Lowell Sun.</p>
<p>The predictions app was designed by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu" target="_blank">Nelson Hsu</a>, built by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/vhagerty/" target="_blank">Vaughn Hagerty</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/sglen/" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a>, and managed by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwalks/" target="_blank">Matt Walks</a> at Thunderdome.</p>
<p>With the regular season having concluded, our experts have kindly agreed to continue making their picks through the postseason, so watch for their playoff and Super Bowl predictions on a DFM site near you.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that our Digital First Represents contestants have completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we're ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents #NICAR14 contest.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p>In September, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/30/nicar14-digital-first-represents/">we kicked off our contest</a> to send three journalists from Digital First Media papers to learn data journalism skills from the best in the business at Investigative Reporters and Editors&#8217; <a title="NICAR 14" href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/" target="_blank">2014 Computer-Assisted Reporting conference</a> in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Today, after our contestants completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we&#8217;re ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents <a title="#NICAR14 on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nicar14" target="_blank">#NICAR14</a> contest.</p>
<p>We received 18 entries from reporters and editors in every cluster of the company. From the Los Angeles Area News Group to New England, enterprising journalists with great ideas threw their hats into the ring.</p>
<p>We expected a lot from the folks who entered this contest. We asked them to jump through hoops that would introduce them to some of the training and support that our company and other journalism organizations can offer.</p>
<p><strong>1. They all had to join our data journalism discussion group</strong>, which now numbers more than 100 members from every DFM state and cluster. (If you&#8217;d like to join the conversation, email data editor Tom Meagher at <a href="mailto: tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>2. Everyone had to complete at least one online class in data journalism</strong>. Many took more than one class. For some, it was an afternoon of <a title="CartoDB Academy" href="http://cartodb.com/academy" target="_blank">interactive mapping with CartoDB</a>. For others, it was a weeks-long <a title="Udacity statistics" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/st101" target="_blank">statistics class from Udacity</a> or an <a title="Introduction to databases" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/db" target="_blank">introduction to databases on Coursera</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. For our judges, though, the most important requirement was that every entrant had to pitch a project</strong> they want to pursue with the skills they hope to learn at NICAR. Because the stories haven&#8217;t run yet, we can&#8217;t tell you too much about the winners&#8217; projects, but rest assured, they will chronicle their reporting process here on InsideThunderdome as their projects develop.</p>
<p>Enough throat clearing. You&#8217;re probably only reading this to find out who won the contest. So who did we decide on? Without further adieu&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Lindsey-Anderson.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6016 alignleft" alt="Lindsey Anderson, Las Cruces Sun-News" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Lindsey-Anderson-150x150.jpg" width="105" height="105" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/L_M_Anderson" target="_blank">Lindsey Anderson</a> </strong>is an education and border reporter at the <a title="Las Cruces Sun-News" href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/" target="_blank">Las Cruces Sun-News</a>. Her favorite stories to cover include issues kids face in southern New Mexico, from teen pregnancy to educational disparities. She graduated from American University in 2012 and has a very expensive travel addiction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/adkins.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-6015 alignright" alt="Sean Adkins, York Daily Record" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/adkins.jpeg" width="77" height="115" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/sadkins75" target="_blank">Sean Adkins</a></strong> is a business reporter with the <a title="York Daily Record" href="http://www.ydr.com/" target="_blank">York Daily Record</a>/Sunday News. Since joining the Daily Record in 2000, he has covered the utility industry, including Three Mile Island and Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, real estate, retail and tourism. His digital and print beat reporting and investigative work has won several awards from the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association.</p>
<p><strong><img class="wp-image-6017 alignleft" alt="Jason Hoppin, Santa Cruz Sentinel" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/photo-11-e1387557418744-150x150.jpg" width="105" height="105" /><a href="https://twitter.com/scnewsdude" target="_blank">Jason Hoppin</a></strong> is a reporter at the <a title="Santa Cruz Sentinel" href="http://santacruzsentinel.com/" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a>, covering the county and the environment in his hometown. Formerly at American Lawyer Media and the <a title="TwinCities.com" href="http://www.twincities.com/" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>, he has covered a number of beats in his career, including crime, state and federal courts, health care, politics and government at all levels. (And he still wants to try his hand at sports).</p>
<p>The winners were selected by our panel of judges, which included data editor <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/" target="_blank">Tom Meagher</a>, interactives editor <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins/" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a> and St. Paul Pioneer Press database editor <a title="MaryJo Webster on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine" target="_blank">MaryJo Webster</a>.</p>
<p>For each of the winners, Digital First Media will pay for the #NICAR14 conference registration and lodging. They (or their newsrooms) have to foot the bill for their travel to Baltimore. In return, the winners have some responsibilities. They will tweet several of the conference sessions. They will write about what they learn at NICAR14 for InsideThunderdome.com. They&#8217;ll also go back to their newsrooms and share their newfound knowledge.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the winners will put their new data skills to immediate use as they pursue significant, data-driven investigative projects in their newsrooms. After those stories run, they&#8217;ll show their work by writing about how they did it for InsideThunderdome.com.</p>
<p>NICAR 14 will be an incredible learning opportunity for these three DFM journalists. It&#8217;s regrettable that we can&#8217;t send more of our colleagues with great data reporting projects in the works as well. But we are confident that we count on Lindsey, Sean and Jason to channel their experience into some really compelling work that we can all learn from.</p>
<p><em>Digital First Media journalists who plan to attend NICAR 14 through other means, leave a comment on this post with your Twitter handle so we can add you to our <a href="https://twitter.com/DFMThunderdome/lists/dfm-staff-at-nicar14" target="_blank">DFM staff at NICAR14 Twitter list</a>. </em></p>

(Thinkstock)" /></p><p><em><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4832" alt="amy_webb" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a>Editor’s note: This is the seventh in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/amy-webb">Amy Webb</a>’s &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/10-tech-trends/#.UncxShXn-mQ">10 Tech Trends for Journalists</a>&#8220; was one of the most fascinating (and entertaining) of the ONA 13 conference (<a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/ona2013" target="_blank">see the slides</a> and <a href="http://www.livestream.com/ona13/video?clipId=pla_18b4730d-fccc-45db-bebd-29c85a86a226" target="_blank">video</a>).</p>
<p>From a demo of MindMeld anticipatory computing to a live drone flight it was an exciting glimpse at the future by the digital futurist. But I left the session thinking, how could this possibly relate to my newsroom right now? We’re barely keeping up with today’s technology, and now we’re supposed to be using Google Glass, talking to virtual personal assistants and learning how to fly drones? I decided to pick four topics, explore them a little more and think of some ways our resources could be applied toward these future trends.</p>
<h1><b>Trend 1: Smart virtual personal assistants (SVPAs)<br />
</b></h1>
<p>The second trend Webb talked about was &#8220;smart virtual personal assistants&#8221; like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/donna-manage-your-day/id617548142">Donna</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osito/id617172452?mt=8">Osito</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tempo-smart-calendar-free/id593819390">Tempo</a> and <a href="https://www.cueup.com/">Cue</a>. Basically, these apps scrape the calendars, contacts lists, social media and email on your phone and combine that data with real-time weather and traffic information to help organize your day. Webb said SVPAs have become a $400 million market(!) in the past 12 months.</p>
<div id="attachment_4826" style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4826  " alt="Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times' info on Election Day?" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg" width="307" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times&#8217; info on Election Day?</p></div>
<p>How can news organizations get into the action? This got me thinking. How does news consumption fit into a person’s daily habits? Here is a very rough estimation of a local person&#8217;s routine in El Paso, Tex.</p>
<p><em><strong>Morning</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skim headlines to see if anything big happened overnight and to see what will happen today.</li>
<li>Check the weather so I know how to dress for the day.</li>
<li>Listen to the radio to learn about any traffic accidents or closures that I should avoid on my commute to work.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>At work</strong>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Possibly do some research on <a href="http://elpasotime.com" target="_blank">elpasotimes.com</a> if my job involves local people and businesses.</li>
<li>If I travel for work, I need continued updates on traffic and weather.</li>
<li>If breaking news happens during the day, I want to be alerted to it and will follow updates from my phone.</li>
<li>May make plans for evening and weekend activities. Look up information on events, restaurants and venues.</li>
<li>Will check for more traffic and weather updates before leaving the office.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Evening</strong>:</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Scan the headlines from the day. May spend some time reading longer features or watching short videos online before bed.</li>
<li>May take a look at my schedule for tomorrow or later in the week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if we got our news from SVPAs?</strong><br />
It seems like SVPAs (at least the ones I looked at) don&#8217;t account for news at this point, which seems like an unfortunate gap (or a great opportunity). What would an SVPA look like if it incorporated content from your local news organization? Take a short trip with me into the future:</p>
<p>In addition to my scheduled events, contacts and social media, the SVPA could include helpful nuggets of &#8220;news I can use.&#8221; In the morning, I would get the latest traffic and weather information and a short news briefing (in text or audio form, depending on my preference).</p>
<p>In the event of breaking news, I&#8217;d get an alert and short updates on how this developing story may affect me. How do I avoid the traffic mess caused by an accident or crime scene? When do I pick up my child in a lockdown situation? Such an app could also link me directly to the El Paso TImes&#8217; social media channels.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Our news and event calendars would also be a great asset for an SVPA. If I&#8217;m reading about an event on elpasotimes.com or on our mobile app, I could save it to my calendar so all the info about the event would automatically populate in the SVPA. Or I could program it to include a series of events, like all UTEP football home games, or all El Paso Symphony Orchestra concerts. Besides the basic &#8220;if you go&#8221; information, the event information could include links to related articles, such as game UTEP game previews, or a review of a play I’m going to.</span></p>
<p>The personalization of these apps make them ideal tools to send me articles I really want to read. Is there a local news topic I’m continually interested in? Is there news about my neighborhood? The app could personally deliver these articles right to my phone as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>Obviously, a lot of work would need to go into restructuring the data of our content and calendars to communicate with such an app. But something like this would definitely make local news a more integrated part of a person&#8217;s day, giving them personalized information as they need it, when they want it.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 2: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>This trend surprised me at first, but after a few slides the connection to journalists seemed obvious to me.</p>
<p>There is typically a low barrier to entry for MOOCs and many are offered for free and with no commitment to continue. Webb called this trend &#8220;snackable&#8221; learning. She said Millennials are particularly fond of MOOCs and referred to them as &#8220;addictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some examples of MOOCs are <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (math and science courses offered free online, with partnerships from some organizations, <a href="http://curious.com">Curious.com</a> (how-to videos on a variety of subjects, some offered for free) and <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> (courses in web development, business fundamentals, product management, etc.). Webb seemed to think there was a good opportunity for partnership with MOOCs like these.</p>
<p>One of Webb’s key points was that a MOOC leverages something you are doing anyway, but packages<strong> </strong>it in a different way. I think she’s right — it’s time for us to get creative about packaging the content we are producing. I also think it would be great to leverage our newsroom&#8217;s talents and interests in a way other than having them write a blog or column.</p>
<p>These are the five types of MOOCs for newsrooms that Webb suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking news analysis cheat sheet</li>
<li>Authentic how-to video</li>
<li>1-minute explainer video</li>
<li>Staff round up</li>
<li>Quiz</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few ideas I had for each of those that I think readers might be interested in. These are localized to El Paso, but could easily be adapted to any locale:</p>
<p><strong>Breaking news analysis cheat sheets</strong> (see The Washington Post’s great <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/29/9-questions-about-syria-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask/">9 things about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining the Mexican drug war</li>
<li>A quick history of El Paso</li>
<li>School cheating investigations in El Paso County</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How-to videos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to make pumpkin tortilla soup</li>
<li>How to plant a vegetable garden in the desert</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also produce how-to videos that help readers contribute their own content</p>
<ul>
<li>How to write an obituary</li>
<li>How to write a classified ad that will get noticed</li>
<li>How to record a professional looking video with your smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1-minute explainer video</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The building of El Paso’s new baseball stadium</li>
<li>How did the Asarco smokestacks get demolished?</li>
<li>Why is global climate change happening?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Staff roundup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Book of the month by a local author from our book page editor</li>
<li>5 can’t miss things to do in El Paso this weekend from our entertainment editor</li>
<li>5 best sports tweets this week</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quiz</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What happened in El Paso this week? 10-question quiz</li>
<li>How well do you know El Paso? 100-question quiz with prizes</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Beyond those, it would be interesting to explore a long-form course on a subject of interest to our readers that would keep them coming back, week after week, familiarizing them with our newsroom. For example, we could do a 10-part El Paso history series with our staff librarian. </span></p>
<h1><strong>Trend 3: Comments<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Webb also had some interesting things to say about the future of reader comments on news sites. She says, as they exist today, comments are not adding value to our product and are a distraction, and gave some horrifying examples to prove her point.</p>
<p>To remedy this, she suggested that news organizations create comment systems that are similar to a cocktail party — only include comments from people that I know or &#8220;find fascinating,&#8221; with the ability to invite others into the conversation.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/LittleGuyInATie" target="_blank">Lucas</a> and I had a discussion about this after the talk. He said, &#8220;Wouldn’t it get boring after awhile, to hear the same old voices in the comment forum?&#8221; I disagreed, thinking commenting on our site could benefit from some curation. Friends and &#8220;top commenters&#8221; could move to the top, with all others after that. Our conversation was a reminder that different people want different things from comments, and it&#8217;s hard to make one system that fits them all.</p>
<p>I checked out a few of the sites that Webb mentioned to see what the cutting edge of commenting technology looks like. <a href="http://gawker.com">Gawker</a> makes you create a <a href="http://kinja.com/" target="_blank">Kinja</a> account (and therefore, a blog) in order for you to comment. They also <a href="http://gawker.com/crime-in-the-hamptons-is-exactly-like-youd-expect-1457278259">inform you when the author of the article is participating</a> (a great idea, I thought). <a href="http://qz.com/">Quartz</a> allows you to annotate in the margins of an article. I was impressed at the look of it, though I wonder if it is too much work for the average reader to click on each paragraph rather than just see all the comments at one glance. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> has three comment views – All, Reader Picks and NYT picks. Though not in Webb&#8217;s presentation, I also took a look at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post</a>, where a &#8220;Community Pundits&#8221; comment appears at the top of the comments section. After that you can choose between Highlighted, Most Recent, Oldest and Most Faved comment views.</p>
<p>My dream comment looks like this (click photo to enlarge):<br />
<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4828" alt="comment_system" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg" width="1134" height="642" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You must sign in, preferably with a social media account tied to your real name. No anonymous commenting.</li>
<li>Readers can comment anywhere in the article, including at the end if they want to write something long.</li>
<li>Readers would have the option to view comments, or not, through options on a floating toolbar on the side of the page. (I’m envisioning something like VH1’s old <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156226/" target="_blank">Pop Up Videos</a> as what the comments might look like.)</li>
<li>Comments from my friends on social media, most popular commenters and the author of the post are color-coded and you could choose to view only those comments if you wish.</li>
<li>A sophisticated algorithm sorts all this out and a real person does not make a full-time job out of filtering comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know, it’s a lot to ask. I think comment forums are one of the trickiest aspects of our site to manage. How do we encourage comments that are fun and insightful that will enhance readers&#8217; engagement with our content? On the other hand, how do we make it so that comments are not a distraction from the content itself? And how do we keep all those trolls away? It&#8217;s a delicate balance and I think more experimentation is a great trend.</p>
<p>Zack Harold recently wrote about <a title="Want to improve your online comments? Don’t feed the trolls" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/11/05/improve-online-comments-feed-trolls/" target="_blank">how to deal with online trolls</a> from a different ONA13 session.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 4: Data<br />
</strong></h1>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Webb says 2014 is the year data goes completely mainstream. She said everyone in the newsroom needs to get experience with data, now.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately she didn’t get to spend too much time on this. But she is right.</p>
<p>Data was a <em>HUGE</em> topic at ONA13. Here are some of the sessions that focused on data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/closing-the-digital-and-data-divide/#.UnfPNETPdJ8">Closing the Digital and Data Divide: Data Journalism in Developing Countries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">Storytelling with Data</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">I Need Data for My Story. Help.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/tower-of-babel-problem/">Data Journalism: The Tower of Babel Problem</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/your-datas-showing/#.UnfPr0TPdJ8">&#8220;Ha, Your Data&#8217;s Showing&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Big Data, Little Newsroom</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Building Your First Data Driven Map with Tile Mill</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/friday-lunch-keynote/#.UnfP30TPdJ8">ONA13 keynote</a> was delivered by Nate Silver of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">fivethirtyeight.com</a>.</p>
<p>So, what needs to happen for newsrooms to fully embrace data journalism?</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two different classes of people in a newsroom and both of them need help:</p>
<p>First, we need to bring people who don’t usually deal with data visualization into the fold and get them to think in a &#8220;data&#8221; mindset. We need to fundamentally rewire the way journalists think about their stories. Data is an integral way of telling a story, especially in a digital format. Many journalists still aren&#8217;t getting it.</p>
<p>But I would argue that the most skilled of the data journalists in smaller newsrooms face a whole slew of problems, too. How many of us are trained statisticians? How do we know how to &#8220;clean&#8221; data and interpret it correctly? How many of us are experienced at coding? One of the biggest obstacles we face is that we lack the manpower to take on big projects. <a href="https://github.com/DFMdata?tab=members" target="_blank">DFM’s data team</a> is a great idea in this respect. They provide professional help for the more ambitious projects we want to take on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting journey digging into just a few technology trends that Webb identified in her crystal ball (I&#8217;m still pondering Google Glass and drones). Webb is someone I&#8217;m definitely going to keep an eye on in the next few years (on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/WebbMedia">@WebbMedia</a>). Who can say which of her trends will end up being &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; but we&#8217;re sure to hear more about everything she talked about.</p>
<p>The unknown can be scary but I&#8217;m also excited about the possibilities for the future of journalism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-07-at-8.32.27-PM-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-07 at 8.32.27 PM" /></p><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine" target="_blank">MaryJo Webster</a> of the Pioneer Press contributed to this report.</em></p>
<p>Pins on a map. That’s what probably comes to most people’s minds when they think of what has come to be known as a &#8220;crime map,&#8221; an online tool for displaying crimes that have occurred over a specific timeframe in a geographic area, usually a city or a county.</p>
<p>That’s how it was with arguably the grandfather of all such apps, the now defunct <a href="http://chicagocrime.org" target="_blank">chicagocrime.org</a>, a display of crimes in the Windy City built by <a href="https://twitter.com/adrianholovaty" target="_blank">Adrian Holovaty</a>. And it’s where we started when considering how to build our own crime maps recently launched by the <a href="stpaulcrime.twincities.com" target="_blank">Pioneer Press in St. Paul</a> and this week at the <a href="http://crime.denverpost.com" target="_blank">Denver Post</a>.</p>
<p>But, pins on a map only gets you so far. It’s difficult to see trends, and while you can draw neighborhood boundaries on the same map, it still doesn’t tell you what all those pins mean beyond &#8220;a crime happened here.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>More than pins on a map</strong><br />
That was the challenge for the Thunderdome data team when we began to envision how this project would look and how someone might use it. Luckily for us, crime maps have evolved since Holovaty’s original. The <a href="http://crime.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">Chicago Tribune’s own crime app</a> is a good example, ranking neighborhoods by crime per capita, among other things. <a href="http://maps.latimes.com/crime/" target="_blank">The Los Angeles Times</a> focuses on trends in communities, using colors to indicate whether crime is edging up or down. These were some of the types of ideas we incorporated into our design.</p>
<p>The main page of our map aims to give users an overview of their town, showing the number of crimes by time or location and whether crime is up or down in particular neighborhoods. Visitors can drill down to the neighborhood level from there, showing – yes – pins on a map, as well as trends for that area.</p>
<p>This first iteration, we think, is fairly simple and easy to use. We&#8217;re considering other features to incorporate in later releases — more filtering options on the main page or the ability to search for a specific crime, for example. Much of that will be driven by feedback from site users and from our newsrooms. Let us know what you think and leave a comment on this post.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s under the hood?</strong><br />
On the technology side, we obviously used <a href="https://maps.google.com/" target="_blank">Google maps</a>, as well as Google’s Visualization API, <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, a JavaScript templating library called <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handlebars</a> and a date library called <a href="http://www.datejs.com/" target="_blank">date.js</a>. All of the sorting, filtering and aggregation happens on the front end in JavaScript, almost all of which is custom-written for this app.</p>
<p>The app never touches a database. Initially, it loads data for all of the current month plus the previous month. It loads earlier data a month at a time as it needs it. This part of the project (inspired in part by a comment from NPR’s <a href="https://twitter.com/brianboyer" target="_blank">Brian Boyer</a> that &#8220;<a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org/2013/02/14/app-template-redux.html?" target="_blank">servers are for chumps</a>&#8220;) is somewhat of an experiment and may change in future versions. Databases are a common bottleneck for online apps, and this lets us avoid that. But these so-called &#8220;baked-out&#8221; files also can be a limitation. They’re fairly big, so the initial page load can be a little slow. They also may limit the amount of customization we can offer.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the data come from?</strong><br />
Obviously, none of this would be possible without the crime data itself. For those Digital First Media properties (or anyone for that matter) who want something similar, the first place to start is with the data. It’s important to note that this data isn’t like the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr" target="_blank">Uniform Crime Statistics</a> that the FBI puts out every year. You really can’t build something like this from aggregate information. You need some sort of constantly updated feed of individual crimes with, at a minimum, an address or at least a block number, a crime type and a time of occurrence.</p>
<p>In the case of Denver, the information comes over as a comma-separated value file, with latitude and longitude included. That’s probably the best anyone could hope for. No scraping. No geocoding. Just pull and slurp into the table.</p>
<p>St. Paul’s is a bit more complicated. First, it’s posted in Excel files on the <a href="http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?nid=461" target="_blank">police department’s website</a>. Second, it has to be geocoded. This is complicated further because the last digit of the number in the addresses has been redacted and the addresses are fairly freeform: some non-standard street-type abbreviations (La for Lane) and some streets whose names are really two words but come over without a space (Mississippiriver). We’ve tried to account for some of this on the back end when we process the data, but some addresses slip through with incorrect locations. So, we created a very rough tool that <a href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine" target="_blank">MaryJo Webster</a> uses to correct the strays.</p>
<p>Partly because of this geocoding challenge, MaryJo used ArcMap to geocode historical data, back to the start of 2010, for the Pioneer Press map. She was able to resolve some of the data problems noted above before the geocoding to get better results.</p>
<p>One of the other challenges with the St. Paul data, which will likely be true in other jurisdictions, is that very few homicides show up. The data includes only certain crime types —primarily the big ones — but it’s common that the police department classifies a murder as a &#8220;death investigation&#8221; and that designation often doesn’t get adjusted in their computer system until a suspect is charged, typically long after the time the data shows up online.</p>
<p><strong>How has St. Paul responded to the Pioneer Press crime map?</strong><br />
Reaction from Pioneer Press readers was swift and included both compliments and criticisms, although most were constructive in nature. One reader was excited to be able to zoom into her neighborhood and find the burglary she had reported to police a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p>The St. Paul mayor’s spokesperson sent a note to the Pioneer Press criticizing the way the initial view of the map color shades the neighborhoods as having crime &#8220;up&#8221; or &#8220;down&#8221; compared to the past. Like many readers, he misunderstood that the comparison of the current month was not to the previous month, but rather the average of the previous 12 months (and it only indicates a change if it’s at least one standard deviation up or down). He wanted us to change it to compare to the same month one year previously, which is how the police department looks at crime trends. That’s not really practical for this app, though, given that we allow users to select the beginning and end dates (up to 31 days&#8217; worth) of data to display, we’d have to try to calculate quite a few &#8220;averages&#8221; to accomplish that. This may be something that we address in future versions, though.</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the mayor’s spokesperson was mostly impressed, saying, &#8220;It’s a really cool and useful feature, and I think we should be doing more of this kind of thing at the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some older readers were frustrated that the map wasn’t included in the print edition (there was only a short story). MaryJo tried to explain that it simply wouldn’t be possible to recreate the full experience of the crime map in print. After hearing an explanation of what the map could do, one of them said she would venture out to the public library to see if somebody would help her navigate the Internet to find the map. Before hanging up, she asked if it would be online just that day, or &#8220;would it be okay to go tomorrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, members of Thunderdome&#8217;s data team headed to the Global Editors Network <a title="Editors' Lab" href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/editors-lab/nyt/" target="_blank">Editors&#8217; Lab</a> at the New York Times to wrestle with how to turn news storytelling into a game. <a title="Editors' Lab at the New York Times" href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/editors-lab-at-the-new-york-times/" target="_blank">The event</a> brought teams from <a title="Editors' Lab teams" href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/editors-lab-newsgaming-ideas/" target="_blank">10 of the country&#8217;s top news organizations</a> together to compete to build the best online news games over the course of a weekend.</p>
<p>Thunderdome data developer <a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" title="Vaughn Hagerty" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/vhagerty/">Vaughn Hagerty</a> described the genesis of <a title="The pitch for The Waffler" href="http://bit.ly/waffler-pitch">our game</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I came up with the basic idea for The Waffler while listening to Columbia Journalism School professor <a title="Susan McGregor" href="https://twitter.com/susanemcg" target="_blank">Susan McGregor</a> <a title="Susan McGregor's master class at #EditorsLab" href="http://bit.ly/ZGpymk" target="_blank">speak about game design</a> and the types of &#8220;play&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">agon (competition)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">alea (chance)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">mimicry (simulation)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">ilinx (vertigo)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I wondered how we might incorporate a number of those aspects into a game that could be (mostly) built during the two days of the competition. The team had already discussed how at least some of the other teams&#8217; entries were likely to be quiz-type apps. We also talked about apps that might highlight some of the shenanigans endemic in politics.</p>
<p>I thought, what about political flip-flopping, where a candidate changes his or her position on a major issue, usually to gain popularity and, of course, votes? Could we build a game to simulate that process?</p>
<p>Thus, <a title="The Waffler" href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/the-waffler/" target="_blank">The Waffler</a> was born.</p></blockquote>
<div style="width: 728px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/the-waffler/"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DFMEL.jpg" width="718" height="477" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Waffler, the game built by members of Project Thunderdome&#8217;s data team at the Editors&#8217;s Lab hack weekend.</p></div>
<blockquote><p>The Waffler was built with HTML, CSS, a few images and a little over 200 lines of JavaScript. I used jQuery for some parts, along with a JavaScript templating library called <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>. A few data structures in the JavaScript keep track of the player&#8217;s choices and help determine when he or she &#8220;waffles.&#8221; I added a timer to help add excitement to the game and to make it more realistic. After all, politicians really don&#8217;t have the option of saying something like &#8220;let me think about it&#8221; when asked about their stances on issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Vaughn worked on the game mechanics, graphics editor <a title="Nelson Hsu" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu/">Nelson Hsu</a> designed the presentation. Data editor <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/">Tom Meagher</a> selected the questions that are thrown at players, researched the real polling data and crafted the final presentation for the jury. The Waffler was deliberately built to be used in any kind of election, from presidential to city council. Its use of poll data and hot-button issues ensure it could have universal appeal.</p>
<p>At the end of the weekend, we were thrilled to learn that <a title="The Waffler" href="http://app.wizehive.com/voting/view/elny2013/14408/1236428/0" target="_blank">our entry</a> was chosen as the first runner-up by the judges.</p>
<p>The winning entry came from the Chicago Tribune&#8217;s <a title="Trib Apps" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">news apps team</a>, which designed a <a title="GEN Editors' Lab news game hackathon" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/gen-newsgaming-hackathon/" target="_blank">Game Center</a> to showcase a series of mini and micro games that could be integrated into any story. There were plenty of other great games that emerged. In a blog post, the team from ProPublica offered a fantastic, <a title="ProPublica nerd blog" href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/heartsaver-an-experiment-in-using-news-games-to-tell-a-story" target="_blank">in-depth look</a> at <a title="HeartSaver" href="http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/heartsaver" target="_blank">HeartSaver</a>, their health care game that will send your pulse racing.</p>
<p>Have you played the games from the <a title="Editors' Lab" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/gen-newsgaming-hackathon/" target="_blank">Editors&#8217; Lab hack event</a> at the Times? Which was your favorite?</p>
