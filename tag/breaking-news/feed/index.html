				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/FLOOD-overall-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="One of the hundreds of Denver Post photos that were part of the DFMie-winning coverage of the Colorado floods. Brian Marquedt, left, and Scott Johnson, right, assist Dan Hull in leaving his flooded home on Hygiene Road in Hygiene, Colo. on Sept. 14, 2013." /></p><p>At the 2013 DFMie awards program, held at the Denver Post, Post staffers were invited to come to the auditorium and fill the stage to accept their <a title="Denver Post Adds DFMie to Awards for Breaking News Coverage" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/denver-post/denver-post-adds-dfmie-awards-breaking-news-coverage-theater-massacre/">2013 Breaking News DFMie</a>. Only a few could. The rest were out winning the<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank"> 2014 Breaking News DFMie</a> for large newsrooms. Colorado&#8217;s Front Range was flooding, and the Post again excelled in its coverage.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a title="Denver Post coverage of Colorado floods" href="http://www.denverpost.com/2013coloradofloods">Post’s coverage of historic flooding</a> began when the first emergency sirens sounded at 10 p.m., Wednesday, Sept. 11, as a wall of water bore down on Boulder. It didn&#8217;t stop for nearly two weeks.</p>
<p>Journalists dashed across the state to reach flood-stricken areas before still-rising rivers cut off access. The deployment allowed us to report with precision and context during the chaotic first days of flooding. The team worked in challenging and, at times, life-threatening conditions, relaying the scope of damage through <a title="Denver Post flood coverage" href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24077193/colorado-flood-at-least-three-killed">continuous posts</a>, blogs, and <a title="Photos of Colorado flooding" href="http://photos.denverpost.com/2013/09/12/photos-massive-flash-flooding-along-front-range-of-colorado/#1">visual reports</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Post’s well-crafted, comprehensive coverage shows this is how you cover a natural disaster. The clear-headed writing, breathtaking personal accounts and excellent visuals gave readers an indispensable account of a fast-moving story. The exceptional use of social media was especially notable; readers were given a full picture of the scope and impact of this historic flood in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of four 2014 DFMies for the Denver Post and one of six for the Colorado newsrooms. Coverage of the Colorado floods by the Daily Camera in Boulder also won the Breaking News DFMie for small newsrooms. The Times-Call in Longmont was also a finalist in the small-newsroom breaking-news competition. In addition, Matthew Jonas, Lewis Geyer, Greg Lindstrom of the Times-Call were finalists in visual journalism for their <a title="Longmont Times-Call flood photography" href="http://photos.timescall.com/2013/09/12/photos-boulder-county-flooding-2013/#1">flood photography</a>.</p>
<p>The Post and Camera also swept the small- and large-newsroom DFMies for investigative or enterprise journalism.</p>
<h3>Other breaking news finalists</h3>
<p>Other large-newsroom finalists in for the Breaking News DFMie were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bay Area News Group</strong>&#8216;s <a title="Asiana Airlines crash" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23611048/faa-asiana-airlines-flight-crashes-while-landing-at?source=pkg">coverage of the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214</a> in San Francisco.</li>
<li><strong>The Salt Lake Tribune</strong> for its coverage of a <a title="Salt Lake Tribune coverage of same-sex-marriage ruling" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/57295302-90/vanessa-katie-marriage-clerk.html.csp">federal judge&#8217;s ruling overturning Utah&#8217;s law banning same-sex marriages</a>.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[Two things happened while the government was shutdown. Our politics channel manager grew a beard, and our news desk maintained a liveblog for the 16-day shutdown.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/AP923506093249-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Vicki Maturo, of Culver City, Calif., protests against the government shutdown which started a day earlier, outside the federal building in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2013 (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)" /></p><p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-22-at-9.16.42-PM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4675" alt="Screen Shot 2013-10-22 at 9.16.42 PM" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-22-at-9.16.42-PM.jpg" width="709" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>The government may have shut down, but Thunderdome was just warming up.</p>
<p>Through the 16 days of the government shutdown, Thunderdome&#8217;s news desk provided a constantly-updated live blog (embedded below) to track every major development for readers of Digital First Media properties. The liveblog provided readers with vital, real-time updates and insight on the debt ceiling, the Capitol Hill shooting on Oct. 3, <a href="https://vine.co/v/hwUwpi0jjqV" target="_blank">shutdown beards</a> and angry stenographers, among other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The effort was spear-headed by one of our most recent additions to the team, politics reporter/producer <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/aphillips/" target="_blank">Amber Phillips</a>, along with help from <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/phogan/" target="_blank">Patrick Hogan</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jsederholm/" target="_blank">Jillian Sederholm</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/chopkins/" target="_blank">Chris Hopkins</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/kworkman/" target="_blank">Karen Workman</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jwestfall/" target="_blank">Julie Westfall</a> of the breaking news desk, and some technical help from live channel manager <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch/" target="_blank">Chris March</a>.</p>
<p>The liveblog was produced with <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a>, the tool Digital First Media properties use for real-time publishing of breaking news liveblogs and chats. The liveblog found an even larger audience outside of Digital First Media through ScribbleLive&#8217;s <a href="https://market.scribblelive.com/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>. <a href="http://live.mprnews.org/Event/Prelude_to_a_Government_Shutdown?Page=0" target="_blank">Minnesota Public Radio</a>, Sun Media, <a href="http://live.boston.com/Event/Following_the_government_shutdown_-_live_blog?Page=0" target="_blank">Boston.com</a>, local news sites in Wisconsin and <a href="http://live.siouxcityjournal.com/Event/Live_Shots_at_Capitol_Hill?Page=0" target="_blank">Sioux City</a> and a handful of other media outlets syndicated the content for use on their own websites. It even made it across the pond, spotted on websites in <a href="http://livestudio.nettavisen.no/Event/USA-nedstengingen?Page=0" target="_blank">Norway</a> and <a href="http://www.lesoir.be/341406/article/actualite/monde/2013-10-16/etats-unis-republicains-et-democrates-trouvent-un-accord-pour-sortir-crise" target="_blank">France</a>. These media sites were able to syndicate our liveblog content for free (we have option to charge a fee for use), and localize it or add their own content to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is great stuff and a testament to the hard work of the politics and breaking teams and a good model for how to handle these kind of sustained news events in the future,&#8221; says Politics Channel Manager <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/rbeckwith/" target="_blank">Ryan Beckwith</a>.</p>
<p>The liveblog remained &#8216;open&#8217; throughout the duration of the government shutdown, tallying 105,000 unique visitors, according to our analytics from ScribbleLive. About half of that viewership came from Digital First Media sites, with the other half from syndication. More impressive is the amount of time viewers spent on the page once getting there &#8211; an average of 12 minutes per view.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know how long the shutdown would last when we started the liveblog,&#8221; says March. &#8220;But by maintaining it throughout the shutdown, this allowed Digital First Media sites to always have the latest on their websites for their readers without having to update anything. We took care of keeping the space fresh, relevant and informative so they didn&#8217;t have to.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>What did you think of the liveblog, Digital First? What did you appreciate most? What can we do to improve our coverage of national breaking news for local websites? </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/Denver_Post_Staff_2013-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="The Denver Post staff, winner of the DFMie for breaking news coverage, among other awards." /></p><p>Despite an outstanding year for breaking news coverage for many Digital First newsrooms, the least-surprising choice for a DFMie is in the breaking news category: The <a href="http://denverpost.com">Denver Post</a> adds a DFMie to the <a title="2013 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting" href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2013-Breaking-News-Reporting">Pulitzer Prize</a> and <a title="'Snow Fall,' Denver Post's Aurora Coverage Win ASNE Awards" href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/206881/snow-fall-denver-posts-aurora-coverage-win-asne-awards/">American Society of News Editors</a> awards (and others) it won for <a title="Denver Post coverage of Aurora theater massacre" href="http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Breaking-News-Reporting">coverage of the massacre at a theater in Aurora, Colo</a>. Post editors detailed the coverage in their nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Post&#8217;s response to the Aurora theater shootings was to publish thousands of stories, Tweets, Facebook posts, photos, videos and interactive elements – all as staffers coped with the emotional toll.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">The main, posted at 2:42 a.m. without benefit of police briefings, was updated 36 times in 18 hours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">The report included photos and videos from staff and public at the scene.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">A live blog included reporters and community members who were reliving a mass shooting similar to the Columbine tragedy.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Interactive maps and timelines in first 12 hours.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We digitally fed the appetite for information Friday, we produced 14 pages for Saturday, and kept this pace for days.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Pulitzer nomination letter by Post Editor <a title="Greg Moore" href="https://twitter.com/gregmooredp">Greg Moore</a> provided more detail on the Post&#8217;s coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>A newsroom grows quiet after midnight. Down to just a couple digital producers, The Denver Post was no different as July 19 gave way to the 20th. Just 39 minutes into that summer day, the quiet was shattered.</p>
<p>An Aurora, Colorado, police dispatcher calmly put out a call for units to head to a movie theater to check out reports of shots fired – not an uncommon event in a metropolitan area. But the second dispatch was different: “There is one person who has been shot. But they say there are hundreds of people running around.” Nearing 1 a.m., Night Producer Paul Soriano was about to turn off the lights. He immediately called the Post’s night city editor and the newsroom roared back to life.</p>
<p>With reporters, photographers and videographers blanketing the scene, the horrific details were published through social media and denverpost.com: 12 dead; 58 injured; panicked survivors; chaos at the 16-screen theater.</p>
<p>Once again, Colorado would be ground zero to mass murder.</p>
<p>In the first few hours after the shooting, we had journalists from every department in the newsroom assigned to dozens of angles. The entire first day of the massacre was published on our digital platforms with updates virtually by the minute. Our social media team was aggressive and creative. Our visual team was beaming the images around the world. We were the primary source for accurate information about the number of dead, the number of wounded and produced the definitive account of what happened in Theater 9 after a man opened fire with an arsenal during the midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises.”</p>
<p>And so began days of around-the-clock coverage. The Denver Post published thousands of stories, Tweets, Facebook posts, photos, videos and interactive elements – all as reporters and editors tried to cope with the emotional toll of the grisly news:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our first Tweet went out at 1:47 a.m.</li>
<li>Determined to publish only what we could confirm, our main breaking news story was first published at 2:42 a.m. without the benefit of police briefings. We updated it 36 times in the first 18 hours after the shooting.</li>
<li>Our main Twitter and Facebook accounts were both pushing and pulling information. Post reporters and photographers were posting information and images on their accounts while editors in the newsroom would fashion the stories from those details.</li>
<li>We published videos from both staff and the public at the scene.</li>
<li>We tended to a live blog that included our reporters as well as community members. That feature was actively managed for four days after the shooting.</li>
<li>We posted interactive maps and timelines in the first 12 hours.</li>
<li>We analyzed and posted audio files of the police and fire radio traffic.</li>
<li>We facilitated conversations on Facebook and our commenting platform for a community stunned to be reliving the trauma after enduring the deadly Columbine school shooting in 1999.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we fed the insatiable appetite for information Friday on our digital platforms, we began planning 14 pages of coverage for Saturday’s newspaper. Included in that report was a graphic of the scene, profiles of victims who had been identified, the anguish of the survivors, details of selfless acts of heroism, a meaty profile of suspect James Holmes and the shocking news that he had booby-trapped his apartment in an apparent attempt to injure first responders and neighbors. And we repeated that performance day after day:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Day 2, while police and bomb experts were successfully untangling the explosives at the suspect’s apartment, officials released the names of the 12 victims. We were on the scene of the apartment, reporting in real time. We put several staffers to the task of profiling each of the victims – online and in print.</li>
<li>On Day 3 the community stopped to remember. Thousands arrived – some driving hours to pay their respects. The makeshift memorial was growing by the minute and President Barack Obama landed to visit hospitals and speak to the community.</li>
<li>On Day 4, we got our first look at James Holmes as he appeared in court. With “a tangle of orangish-red hair atop his head like a bizarre costume wig,” Holmes barely paid attention. The legal battle had begun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incredibly, we were able to maintain this pace of reporting for several days, including producing a special section extolling the heroic acts of people inside the theater, and an enterprise story raising serious questions about how ambulances responded to the shooting.</p>
<p>For the first 96 hours, media from around the world created a frenzy in Aurora. We were determined to be aggressive but measured, fast but accurate – our community would demand that. There were inaccurate rumors on the death count, the background of the suspect and investigation information that hit other outlets – but not one appeared on Denver Post platforms.</p>
<p>Our supplemental material includes a log of our major digital elements during the first four days, the main story from Saturday’s newspaper, an enterprise story on the poor response of ambulance crews, a story on the immediate spike in gun sale permits, PDFs of our daily newspaper coverage, PDFs of the denverpost.com home page as it progressed through the weekend, PDFs and stories from our special section Heroes Among Us, and a video from that effort.</p>
<p>We are proud of the ways we served our community during this tragic story. There is no forecast for a mass shooting. There is no chance to halt vacations, plan stories or prepare the staff. There is only the training, skill and drive of your newsroom.</p>
<p>We are pleased to submit our coverage of the Aurora theater shootings for consideration for the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting of Breaking News.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges joined those praising the Post&#8217;s coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sophisticated and humanizing reporting, elegant writing, Pulitzer-caliber photography, chilling graphics and other informative visuals provided readers with a compelling description and analysis of the Aurora, Colo., theater massacre. The coverage offered reliable clarity when readers needed to know the basic facts, and showed impressive enterprise in guiding readers to new places. We also admired the restraint and clear sense of purpose apparent in the use of social media.</p></blockquote>

<div id="attachment_3306" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/charleston-daily-mail/zack-harold-wins-dfmie-social-media/zack-harold/" rel="attachment wp-att-3306"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3306" alt="Zack Harold" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Zack-Harold-259x300.jpg" width="259" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zack Harold</p></div>
<p><a title="Zack Harold" href="http://muckrack.com/ZackHarold">Zack Harold</a> of the Charleston Daily Mail wins the DFMie for best use of social media for his <a title="Major explosion in Sissonville" href="http://storify.com/zackharold/possible-explosion-in-sissonville">coverage of a pipeline explosion in West Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>His editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zack Harold spearheaded our social media coverage of a gas pipeline explosion on Dec. 11. The pipeline caused a monster fireball that rumbled toward Interstate 77, scorching homes, burning trees, melting cars and making the highway asphalt crumble. As the situation developed, Zack used Storify to compile social media updates from media and residents about what was happening at the scene. The Storify served as a reservoir of breaking news and reaction, and received 4,677 views.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained why this was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zack Harold&#8217;s Storify of the Sissonville explosion is a great example of how journalists can use social media to provide useful information during a breaking news event. Harold showed a great deal of insight into what people would want to know during the event &#8212; where to go for shelter, which roads were closed, reports of any injuries &#8212; and what they might want to know afterwards, like how asphalt actually melted during the gas line explosion. He also guided those who weren&#8217;t familiar with Storify as a tool, by reminding them how to use it along the way. By giving multiple accounts of the accident, gathering pictures from social media, and pulling from the official emergency response messages, he was able to give a well-rounded picture of what was going on in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists in the social media category were:</p>

</ul>
<p>Harold is a state government reporter for the Charleston Daily Mail in Charleston, W.Va. A native West Virginian, Harold is a 2009 graduate of the University of Charleston, where he studied print journalism, and joined the Daily Mail shortly after completing his degree.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/post-celebration-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Denver Post Reporter Jordan Steffan and Assistant Managing Editor Tim Rasmussen celebrate after learning that the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Coverage for their efforts in the hours and days following the Aurora Theater Shooting. The Denver Post also had two other finalists in various categories. (Joe Amon/The Denver Post)" /></p><p>On Monday, the Denver Post was awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for its coverage of the July 20, 2012, shooting at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colo.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize Board issued the following citation with the prize:</p>
<blockquote><p>Awarded to The Denver Post Staff for its comprehensive coverage of the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., that killed 12 and injured 58, using journalistic tools, from Twitter and Facebook to video and written reports, both to capture a breaking story and provide context.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Breaking-News-Reporting">entry documents</a> submitted by the newsroom show how a modern news organization can utilize <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews02.pdf">social media</a>, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews04.pdf">video</a>, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews03.pdf">photography</a>, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews07.pdf">interactive media</a> and, most importantly, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews01.pdf">solid reporting</a> to cover breaking news in realtime (note: links are to PDFs).</p>
<p>“We all wish July 20 never happened, but it did, and I could not be more proud of The Denver Post for its exhaustive and creative coverage,” said Post editor Gregory L. Moore in <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23029438/denver-post-staff-wins-pulitzer-prize-aurora-theater">an article published by the paper</a>. “It is a great achievement to have that work honored with a Pulitzer Prize.”</p>
<p>This was the Post’s fourth Pulitzer Prize in as many years, a winning streak matched only by the New York Times.</p>
<p>“Winning a Pulitzer Prize four years in a row is beyond impressive, it’s awe-inspiring,” said Jim Brady, editor-in-chief of Digital First Media. “This speaks to the incredible commitment to high-quality journalism that has driven the Post newsroom for so many years, but also to its ability to deliver on that commitment across so many platforms. The Aurora tragedy was one that required use of all those platforms, and the Post delivered on all of them, and that is because of the world-class newsroom that Greg Moore has built.”</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Denver Post and <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/node/8501">all other winners</a>.</p>

The California newsrooms did a great job of <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/ci_22161714/ntsb-singer-jenni-rivera-confirmed-dead-mexican-plane">breaking the news</a> of her death and <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/ci_22219218/jenni-rivera-memorial-be-held-wednesday-at-gibson">memorializing</a> the legacy of the 43-year-old Rivera, who sold more than 15 million albums in the U.S. and Mexico during her career. The work of the reporters and editors in covering the public grieving of her fans was comprehensive, tasteful and worthy of a DFMie</p>
<p>More than 6,000 fans came out to remember Rivera at a public memorial service, but for the thousands of other fans across the U.S. and the rest of the Spanish-speaking world, the Daily News provided respectful moment-by-moment coverage in the form of a <a href="http://live.dailynews.com/Event/Jenni_Rivera_memorial_service?Page=0">thorough liveblog of the event</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/Charleston-Daily-Mail-explosion-photos-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Charleston Daily Mail Facebook album of pipeline explosion photos" /></p><p>A pipeline explosion is the kind of classic breaking news story that journalists have raced to cover for generations. But a pipeline explosion today does more than just send a fireball into the sky &#8212; it shuts down an Interstate highway and sparks a social media explosion of cell-phone photos and eyewitness accounts.</p>
<p>The Charleston Daily Mail excelled in old-school reporting and photojournalism as well as curating the social media stream in coverage of the Dec. 11 explosion of a Columbia Gas line near Sissonville, W.Va. The staff coverage of the blast won the DFMie for December for the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster of Digital First Media.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>On the scanner, police are reporting a &#8220;major gas line fire&#8221; near Sissonville.</p>
<p>&mdash; Zack Harold (@ZackHarold) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackHarold/status/278558630469586945">December 11, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Northbound traffic now shut down at the I77/79 split in Charleston &#8211; northbound traffic being diverted to I79. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23KanCoBlast">#KanCoBlast</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jared Hunt (@jaredwv) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredwv/status/278570277619781632">December 11, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Editor Nanya Friend explained in her nomination how the Daily Mail staff covered the blast:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Dec. 11, the Charleston Daily Mail staff learned that a gas pipeline had exploded in a residential area. Turned out it was a monster fireball that rumbled toward Interstate 77, scorching homes, burning trees, melting cars and making the highway asphalt crumble. We sent three reporters and a photographer to the scene, while three reporters stayed in the office, making calls and helping monitor social media posts.</p>
<p>We created the hashtag <a title="#KanCoBlast" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23kancoblast&amp;src=typd">#KanCoBlast</a>, and encouraged other news organizations to use it. Our live reporters used the hashtag in their tweets from the scene. We used the newspaper Twitter account to retweet the reporters and to share photos, video and graphics as they became available.</p>
<p>We created three different Storify streams during the first hours of coverage. As the news developed, we updated an <a title="Storify of Sissonville gas explosion" href="http://storify.com/zackharold/possible-explosion-in-sissonville">initial Storify</a> that served as a reservoir of breaking news and reaction. That Storify received more than 4,000 views. Later, we created a <a title="Photos of pipeline explosion" href="http://storify.com/bradmcelhinny/photos-of-the-kancoblast">Storify of just photos</a>, and then a Storify the next day detailing the <a title="I-77 reopens with amazing speed" href="http://storify.com/bradmcelhinny/i-77-re-opens-with-amazing-speed-here-s-how-it-hap">overnight repaving efforts on the interstate</a>. Those other stories received a combined 1,000+ views.</p>
<p>On Facebook, we created a <a title="Charleston Daily Mail photo gallery" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151157863481272.447482.17795641271&amp;type=1&amp;l=8fb9c0e6bf">photo gallery</a> of submitted and staff photos, which we continued to update. The photo album itself was shared 200 times, and several of the individual photos received dozens of shares.   We also posted to Facebook and Twitter two graphics we created &#8212; a <a title="Pipeline explosion locator map" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151157890786272&amp;set=pb.17795641271.-2207520000.1355347700&amp;type=3&amp;theater">locator map</a> showing where the blast occurred, and a <a title="Pipeline explosion detour map" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151158039261272&amp;set=pb.17795641271.-2207520000.1355347682&amp;type=3&amp;theater">detour map</a> telling travelers the best route while the interstate was closed. These graphics received several shares and retweets on both social networks.</p>
<p>On our website, we posted an <a title="Gas line explosion creates Interstate inferno" href="http://www.dailymail.com/policebrfs/201212110063">initial breaking news story</a>, which received more than 600 Facebook recommendations. We kept this story updated with confirmed reports, photos, video, and a link to the Storify. We also shared this story on Facebook, where it received almost 50 shares, and Twitter, where it was retweeted dozens of times. We added a video to our story, and the video received more than 1,400 views.</p>
<p>The next day, coverage dominated the front page of our print edition. We posted the photo to Facebook, where it received more than 50 shares.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Daily Mail hit several factors on this story: great breaking news coverage; using multiple digital tools such as social media and video; and community engagement by integrating reader comments, photos and videos into their coverage.</p>
<p>I was impressed by the way the staff scrambled to update the breaking story, to create a Storify to pull in reader comments and multimedia, to put updates on Twitter and their blog, and to really involve readers in telling the story. They have also continued to follow up on the story, covering the impact on the victims as well as the investigation into the explosion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Breaking news is always exciting for reporters and editors but the new digital tools available for doing compelling storytelling give us lots of great options to catch readers and the Daily Mail did this well. The stories were complete (and I notice they have done lots of good follow-up coverage) but the visuals – posted via Twitter, Facebook and Storify – really made me take notice.</p>
<p>The immediacy of the disaster was captured by the photo postings and this was a tremendous visual story with the monster fireball consuming the neighborhood. Creating a hashtag early was a great move so that readers could follow the news as it developed on the scene from multiple sources. Getting so many hits on the Storify presentations must have been rewarding for the newsroom crew.</p>
<p>The locator map and detour map were also useful additions for readers. Experimenting with Facebook, Twitter and other social media is a learning experience for all newsrooms as we figure out how to expand our audience and how to crowdsource on breaking stories; it sounds like these tools worked well for this story so kudos to the reporters, photographers and editors who pulled it all together.</p></blockquote>

<p>As the story developed and the death toll became clear, the paper chased all angles of the story, incorporating tried and true shoe leather reporting, public records and database analysis to flesh out a picture of the shooter, his victims and workplace violence in the Gopher State. This is a textbook example of how a news organization can and should cover the breaking story of a tragedy in its backyard</p>
