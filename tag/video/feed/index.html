				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Fred-Robledo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Fred Robledo" /></p><p><iframe id="tout_embed" style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/e27qsn" height="428" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Fred Robledo</strong> of the Los Angeles News Group won the <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners">2014 Short Video DFMie</a> for capturing a buzzer-beating basketball shot.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fred Robledo captured this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tout</span> of a dramatic, buzzer-beating basket from the California’s Southern Section high school basketball playoffs. The video, of the basket by Jeremy Hemsley lifting Damien to a 74-72 victory over Mission Oak, immediately went viral and was picked up across the nation.</p>
<p>(What was particularly notable was that <a title="Fred Robledo video" href="http://www.tout.com/m/u39kcm">Robledo also captured the play at the end of regulation</a> that sent the game into overtime in the first place. This one isn’t the entry, but just fun to watch).</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision went into overtime, but the judges give the top score to FredRobledo for his Tout video of a buzzer beater that made the crowd go wild. Being at the right place, at the right time, and pressing the &#8220;record&#8221; button to capture a moment that really means something to the community &#8212; that&#8217;s a winner.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of five DFMies for the Los Angeles News Group. <a title="Fred Robledo wins July Tout Bout" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/30/fred-robledo-wins-july-tout-bout/">Robledo&#8217;s video also won the first ToutBout</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/2014dfmies-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="2014dfmies" /></p><p><strong>Meghan Lyden</strong>, <strong>Mahala Gaylord</strong>, <strong>AAron Ontiveroz</strong> and <strong>Helen H. Richardson</strong> of the Denver Post won the <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Long Video DFMie</a> for their 30-minute documentary &#8221;<a title="&quot;The Fire Line&quot;" href="http://www.denverpost.com/fireline/ci_24638312/watch-fire-line/">The Fire Line</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Their editors&#8217; nomination explains: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#8220;The Fire Line&#8221; was a five-month project by the Denver Post that highlighted the issues of wildfires in Colorado and the future of fire policy in the state. This first-ever documentary offers amazing footage of the Waldo Canyon and Black Forest fires, interviews with Colorado leaders in wildfire policy, research and firefighting. The staffers conducted interviews across the state, researched countless videos and fire photos from professionals and the public and uncovered the firsthand accounts of what happens while a fire rages out of control.</span></p>
<p>After the video aired (and was also broadcast by our local television partner), The Post received requests from across the country and Canada for copies of the documentary to be used in first-responder trainings and community meetings dealing with mitigation and wildfire education. In addition, Will May, chair of the International Association of Fire Chiefs&#8217; Wildland Fire Committee, showed the video to the entire board of directors and guests at their meeting in Washington.</p>
<p>This documentary demonstrates what a staff can be capable of when enough care and dedication go into a task.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">We were impressed with the Denver Post team&#8217;s ability to shoot stunning visuals, pull together powerful archival footage and devote the time and resources necessary to tell a large story about a very important issue. The team was able to find a good range of compelling characters who came across well on camera and delivered interviews that gave us a deep appreciation for the work firefighters do.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This was one of four DFMies for the Denver Post and one of six for the Colorado newsrooms.</p>

She has covered all of the major fires in Colorado in the past 10 years, three of which were in the past two years alone: the Waldo Canyon Fire, High Park Fire and Black Forest Fire.</p>
<p>She was excited to work on this project &#8220;because wild land fires or forest fires are a real and present threat to living in the American West. Having the time to speak to people with in-depth knowledge of the problems faced in communities living in fire zones has been one of the highlights of the past few years for me.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/20140304__0305joebell3-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="WWII veteran, Joe Bell, 95, became a viral video Internet sensation after Mercury News writer Julia Prodis-Sulek posted a Tout video of the spontaneous tributes Bell received while he stood in front of his home cheering on participants during the annual Pat Tillman running race. (Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group)" /></p><p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/g85kk7" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reasonable chance that you or someone you know has seen this video. It shows runners breaking off in the middle of a race to thank World War II veteran Joe Bell for his service. Bell was watching the race in uniform from the sidewalk outside his home.</p>
<p>Since the video went online Sunday, it has been picked up by dozens of media outlets — including Yahoo&#8217;s front page, Good Morning America, The Today Show and ESPN — and racked up more than one million shares online.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, the online clip had logged more than 1.2 million views. To put that in perspective, all of Digital First Media&#8217;s Tout accounts logged just over 1.8 million views in all of February. Suffice it to say, this video is a bona fide viral sensation, especially in the San Jose community.</p>
<p>The viral nature of this video is even more remarkable when you consider that the reporter who captured it, <a href="https://twitter.com/juliasulek" target="_blank">Julia Prodis Sulek</a> of the <a href="http://mercurynews.com" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, was not on assignment. She was in her house, watching the moment unfold from her window, when she realized it needed to be captured and shared.</p>
<p>She explains in an email to Inside Thunderdome:</p>
<blockquote><p>I woke up to the sounds of the runners in the morning. I looked out my window and wondered why some of them were running on the sidewalk. I looked down the street and saw Joe Bell in uniform with runners shaking his hand. I was so touched and wondered whether I should run out in my fuzzy pink bathrobe. I put clothes on instead, figuring I had missed the moment anyway, and ran outside. It was a lull at the time, but with Joe cheering people on, others cheered him back. So I started filming that. And amazingly, one runner peeled off to shake his hand, then another and another. What I loved about the tribute to Joe is that those tributes kept coming in waves throughout the race. It wasn&#8217;t like a long procession with everyone following each other. It would stop, then organically start up again. Loved it, and happy to have captured it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps what makes the video so appealing to viewers around the country is that it captures a raw moment of heart-warming honesty. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_25271319/wwii-vet-becomes-viral-video-star-san-jose-tribute" target="_blank">In this followup story</a>, Matt Bell (Joe&#8217;s son) tells Julia, &#8221;There was nothing staged about it. It was an honest response from honest people. We don&#8217;t see that too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some clips of Julia and Joe recounting the moment. These were filmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/garyjreyes" target="_blank">Gary Reyes</a>, also of the San Jose Mercury News.</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/h6ysf6" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Joe Bell explains what encouraged him to go outside and watch the race from the sidewalk. &#8220;At 95, you like to see people, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/m3bzzg" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Here is a partial list (in no particular order) of the media coverage the video has received since catching the Internet&#8217;s jet stream.</p>

<p>In retrospect, this is one of those heart-warming videos that seems tailor-made for the <a href="http://upworthy.com" target="_blank">Upworthys</a> of the world. But it isn&#8217;t always easy to determine what readers will care about. Sometimes you have something that seems like a logical candidate to become a viral sensation, such as this <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/2013/11/19/the-ichicken-has-arrived/" target="_blank">&#8220;iChicken&#8221; video</a>, also from the San Jose Mercury News. But maybe the stories people want to share are happening right now outside your window. Don&#8217;t let those pass you by.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong> What lessons or conclusions can be drawn from this video&#8217;s success? What about the video captured the internet&#8217;s attention this week? Would the results have been different if covered by a smaller news outlet in a different community? Would the results have been different on a different week? Share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Head southwest on Saugerties Manor toward Highway 32 north New York 212 West New York 32 North route 32 North state 32 North state highway 32 North state route 32 North.”<br />
- Google Maps</p></blockquote>
<p>Those were the instructions as we (<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/yleow" target="_blank">Yvonne Leow</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/sglen" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a> and myself) arrived in Saugerties, NY, on a brief road trip from Manhattan. The little smartphone voice commanded it twice when all we were hoping for was &#8220;turn right.&#8221; Or maybe left? We laughed it off because we weren’t yet aware of Google&#8217;s abilities to give life lessons through metaphor; I think it’s still in beta. And through indecipherable and logically inverted geographic nonsensery, our apoplectic maps app omnisciently hinted at the twists and turns of the days to follow. And we guessed right, which turned out to be correct.</p>

<p><strong>It seemed so simple</strong><br />
We entered into this project with the goal of exploring Jimmy Fallon’s roots, and we took advantage of the proximity of our Manhattan headquarters to Fallon’s hometown. We rented a car and drove upstate to talk to locals about his life before Late Night. But we wanted to do this in a more interesting way than usual. So we decided to forgo the standard interview style video and instead make a parody of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4&amp;feature=kp" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon’s popular Late Night sketch, slow jam the news</a> — with all appropriate historical interview info in place. Piece of cake, right?</p>
<p><strong>The first problem: Less time than anticipated</strong><br />
Sarah pre-interviewed the teachers before we arrived, and we began incorporating their stories into a rough draft of the script the day before the shoot. But we didn’t have a chance to finish by the time we checked into the hotel, just before midnight. When we finally called it quits, at around 4 or 5 a.m., we still had some shooting logistics to figure out. We discovered earlier in the day that there was no way to get more than 40 minutes with the students. For a shoot that we would never budget less than four hours for, not including location scout and setup, we had the length of one high school class period to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>The second problem: Much larger cast than anticipated</strong><br />
We arrived about an hour early to get a look at our location, and to unload our equipment. But we couldn’t do much else, as there was a class in our room right before the shoot. On top of that, the 3-4 musicians from the high school band we were hoping for turned into about 50-60. You can imagine how this changed the scale of the composition of what was supposed to be a single shot done in one take. Not to mention our ability to actually hear our teachers talking. That’s a whole lot of high school band.</p>
<p>But these kids were excited. All 50+ of them turning around approval forms from their parents overnight. One of them even made Mr. Fallon a big sign that read &#8220;Jimmy Fallon you make us Smile.&#8221; You’ll recognize it as the happy face turned creepy face at the closing of the video. And our slow jammers, the two brave non-actor teachers tasked with the responsibility of getting through some lengthy cue cards at eight o’clock in the morning — they had very little time to &#8220;get in character.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The first take (sort of)</strong><br />
After half of one take, we had to cut. It was impossible to hear the teachers through the band, our timing with the cue cards was way off, the planned camera moves and focus shifts were failing, and it was clear that we needed to talk through the material with our cast. We made the decision on the spot to record the band completely separately, and then have them mime their performance behind the teachers when we filmed their dialogue. While the students recorded the slow jam version of their high school song, we took the teachers aside and walked them through the finer points of the script. We coached them and gave them pointers, mostly line reads and explanations of the jokes that may have gone over their heads otherwise. We suggested points of emphasis and some basic stage direction and we returned to our shooting location with less than 10 minutes to finish.</p>
<p><strong>The only full take</strong><br />
We did one complete take of the entire script. That’s all we had time for. Under ideal conditions we would’ve shot them many times, as many as possible, and would’ve gone in from the wide shot to grab doubles and singles to edit in if the one take idea wasn’t working. But we only got one chance before the bell rang and the period was over. Fortunately, our teachers didn’t have a class next period.</p>
<p>Yvonne, Sarah and myself stepped out into the hallway for a quick pow-wow. It was very evident that at that point we did not have what we needed to make a good video. And since we just lost our giant room full of kids, we didn’t have a lot to fall back on. But, maybe because the cafeteria coffee was starting to kick in, we continued to roll with the punches and decided to shoot close-ups of the teachers, even though the kids were gone. One advantage we had was the big smiley face that one of the students created. That smiley was being waved around in the background during the one take we shot. And it became the only movement and visual link to someone else in the room during our close-ups.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much else we could do after that. We got what we got. It was in the can. We spent the rest of the afternoon running around grabbing b-roll of the high school and town. As part of the parody, the idea was to make a cool, Tonight Show-like opening. Flashy shots of Main Street would whip into a busy school hallway and smash-zoom into Fallon’s yearbook photo — all to an upbeat soundtrack and covered with slick graphics. Easy enough.</p>
<p><strong>We almost scrapped it</strong><br />
Comedy, as anyone who has ever attempted it knows, is one of the hardest things to pull off successfully. It’s very subjective. And with our rushed-script, non actors, and compromised production schedule, we were set up for failure. The first time I looked at the footage I decided to come up with a pseudonym for myself. There was no way my name was going on this. I reported back to Yvonne that it might be worse than we thought it was. But she encouraged me to try and string something together. To see if there’s anything good in there at all.</p>
<p><strong>A different video emerges</strong><br />
The longer I stared at the footage, that long raw take, the more flaws I found. It was always the plan to intentionally shoot it in a sort of low budget, community TV-style — the idea being that we could never pull off Tonight Show-level production with our limited crew and equipment. So we embraced our shortcomings. And I started paying more attention to those little looks the teachers gave between cut and action in the close ups. That was the key. While the camera was still rolling between takes, it caught our kind subjects in moments of strict attention, dismissal, exasperation, laughter, frustration, boredom and whatever else could be interpreted via the license creative. Those reaction shots became something I could work with. The moments the teachers weren’t acting, quickly became some of my favorite moments.</p>
<p>I made the decision to take this train wreck and drag it back and forth across the tracks. If this was going to be bad, it was going to be real bad. Every edit from that point forth was made with the highly committed goal of mining humor where there otherwise was none, utilizing the formula: Bad = good. Finding the painfully awkward moments, and turning them into funny awkward moments. The band was recorded separately, and their track didn’t synch. Who cares! In the close up shots it was obvious that the students had vanished. Big deal! The written jokes weren’t landing, but the non-written moments in between were.</p>
<p>I laughed to myself often as I cut this. My team saw me, and I know it gave them some hope that maybe something good was coming. But I really wasn’t sure. I was in that zone somewhere between when you’re really tired and everything is funny, and that feeling of when all is lost and there’s nothing left to lose. So I couldn’t tell if what I was doing was actually funny, or just funny to me. But I kept trusting that initial impulse of bad = good. And that the weird little choices would be funny to at least some small, strange segment of humanity.</p>
<p>Once the slow jam part of the project was finished, there was no way I could build the slick and complex opening sequence we had planned. Our revised opening had to be as low rent as the rest of the piece, or it would stand out in the wrong way. It needed bad fonts, an off-putting Sears portait-style floating Fallon, and random jazz music to cap the absurdity.</p>
<p>The first few people watched and, surprisingly, they all laughed at the right places. They acknowledged that this was, in fact, odd, but laughing cannot be argued. Several people pointed out potential errors, like bad lip synch, inaccurate graphics, and typos &#8211; all of which were intentional. The quick answer to the question of “is it supposed to be like that” became: yes. Bad = good. So people got it &#8230; mostly. And they stood behind it. I didn’t use a pseudonym, and the piece went out like it was always supposed to be that way.</p>
<p><strong>The final result</strong><br />
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QiCZnoqunnw" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
What we ended up with feels like a strangely authentic and sweet look at a public high school arts program paying homage to one of their own. Our experience through the project was an unexpected and meandering path of many wrong turns, much like our Google Maps welcome to Saugerties. But we did arrive, eventually, and Jimmy Fallon even Tweeted the video the next day. So yeah, the people of Saugerties High are Twitter-famous now.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Here&#8217;s a funny slow jam from my high school. Well done, Sawyers! <a href="http://t.co/JrLrvMczA3">http://t.co/JrLrvMczA3</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23saugerties&amp;src=hash">#saugerties</a></p>
<p>— jimmy fallon (@jimmyfallon) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/statuses/433280208154951680">February 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>And THAT is how we slow-jammed Jimmy Fallon.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Forget about drones and Google Glass for a minute. Annette Arrigucci explores the possibilities of four tech trends that can make a difference in newsrooms right now.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/179002120-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Forget the flashy drones and cyborg glasses for a minute. These tech trends can make a difference now. (Thinkstock)" /></p><p><em><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4832" alt="amy_webb" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a>Editor’s note: This is the seventh in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/amy-webb">Amy Webb</a>’s &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/10-tech-trends/#.UncxShXn-mQ">10 Tech Trends for Journalists</a>&#8220; was one of the most fascinating (and entertaining) of the ONA 13 conference (<a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/ona2013" target="_blank">see the slides</a> and <a href="http://www.livestream.com/ona13/video?clipId=pla_18b4730d-fccc-45db-bebd-29c85a86a226" target="_blank">video</a>).</p>
<p>From a demo of MindMeld anticipatory computing to a live drone flight it was an exciting glimpse at the future by the digital futurist. But I left the session thinking, how could this possibly relate to my newsroom right now? We’re barely keeping up with today’s technology, and now we’re supposed to be using Google Glass, talking to virtual personal assistants and learning how to fly drones? I decided to pick four topics, explore them a little more and think of some ways our resources could be applied toward these future trends.</p>
<h1><b>Trend 1: Smart virtual personal assistants (SVPAs)<br />
</b></h1>
<p>The second trend Webb talked about was &#8220;smart virtual personal assistants&#8221; like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/donna-manage-your-day/id617548142">Donna</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osito/id617172452?mt=8">Osito</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tempo-smart-calendar-free/id593819390">Tempo</a> and <a href="https://www.cueup.com/">Cue</a>. Basically, these apps scrape the calendars, contacts lists, social media and email on your phone and combine that data with real-time weather and traffic information to help organize your day. Webb said SVPAs have become a $400 million market(!) in the past 12 months.</p>
<div id="attachment_4826" style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4826  " alt="Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times' info on Election Day?" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg" width="307" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times&#8217; info on Election Day?</p></div>
<p>How can news organizations get into the action? This got me thinking. How does news consumption fit into a person’s daily habits? Here is a very rough estimation of a local person&#8217;s routine in El Paso, Tex.</p>
<p><em><strong>Morning</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skim headlines to see if anything big happened overnight and to see what will happen today.</li>
<li>Check the weather so I know how to dress for the day.</li>
<li>Listen to the radio to learn about any traffic accidents or closures that I should avoid on my commute to work.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>At work</strong>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Possibly do some research on <a href="http://elpasotime.com" target="_blank">elpasotimes.com</a> if my job involves local people and businesses.</li>
<li>If I travel for work, I need continued updates on traffic and weather.</li>
<li>If breaking news happens during the day, I want to be alerted to it and will follow updates from my phone.</li>
<li>May make plans for evening and weekend activities. Look up information on events, restaurants and venues.</li>
<li>Will check for more traffic and weather updates before leaving the office.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Evening</strong>:</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Scan the headlines from the day. May spend some time reading longer features or watching short videos online before bed.</li>
<li>May take a look at my schedule for tomorrow or later in the week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if we got our news from SVPAs?</strong><br />
It seems like SVPAs (at least the ones I looked at) don&#8217;t account for news at this point, which seems like an unfortunate gap (or a great opportunity). What would an SVPA look like if it incorporated content from your local news organization? Take a short trip with me into the future:</p>
<p>In addition to my scheduled events, contacts and social media, the SVPA could include helpful nuggets of &#8220;news I can use.&#8221; In the morning, I would get the latest traffic and weather information and a short news briefing (in text or audio form, depending on my preference).</p>
<p>In the event of breaking news, I&#8217;d get an alert and short updates on how this developing story may affect me. How do I avoid the traffic mess caused by an accident or crime scene? When do I pick up my child in a lockdown situation? Such an app could also link me directly to the El Paso TImes&#8217; social media channels.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Our news and event calendars would also be a great asset for an SVPA. If I&#8217;m reading about an event on elpasotimes.com or on our mobile app, I could save it to my calendar so all the info about the event would automatically populate in the SVPA. Or I could program it to include a series of events, like all UTEP football home games, or all El Paso Symphony Orchestra concerts. Besides the basic &#8220;if you go&#8221; information, the event information could include links to related articles, such as game UTEP game previews, or a review of a play I’m going to.</span></p>
<p>The personalization of these apps make them ideal tools to send me articles I really want to read. Is there a local news topic I’m continually interested in? Is there news about my neighborhood? The app could personally deliver these articles right to my phone as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>Obviously, a lot of work would need to go into restructuring the data of our content and calendars to communicate with such an app. But something like this would definitely make local news a more integrated part of a person&#8217;s day, giving them personalized information as they need it, when they want it.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 2: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>This trend surprised me at first, but after a few slides the connection to journalists seemed obvious to me.</p>
<p>There is typically a low barrier to entry for MOOCs and many are offered for free and with no commitment to continue. Webb called this trend &#8220;snackable&#8221; learning. She said Millennials are particularly fond of MOOCs and referred to them as &#8220;addictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some examples of MOOCs are <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (math and science courses offered free online, with partnerships from some organizations, <a href="http://curious.com">Curious.com</a> (how-to videos on a variety of subjects, some offered for free) and <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> (courses in web development, business fundamentals, product management, etc.). Webb seemed to think there was a good opportunity for partnership with MOOCs like these.</p>
<p>One of Webb’s key points was that a MOOC leverages something you are doing anyway, but packages<strong> </strong>it in a different way. I think she’s right — it’s time for us to get creative about packaging the content we are producing. I also think it would be great to leverage our newsroom&#8217;s talents and interests in a way other than having them write a blog or column.</p>
<p>These are the five types of MOOCs for newsrooms that Webb suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking news analysis cheat sheet</li>
<li>Authentic how-to video</li>
<li>1-minute explainer video</li>
<li>Staff round up</li>
<li>Quiz</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few ideas I had for each of those that I think readers might be interested in. These are localized to El Paso, but could easily be adapted to any locale:</p>
<p><strong>Breaking news analysis cheat sheets</strong> (see The Washington Post’s great <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/29/9-questions-about-syria-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask/">9 things about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining the Mexican drug war</li>
<li>A quick history of El Paso</li>
<li>School cheating investigations in El Paso County</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How-to videos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to make pumpkin tortilla soup</li>
<li>How to plant a vegetable garden in the desert</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also produce how-to videos that help readers contribute their own content</p>
<ul>
<li>How to write an obituary</li>
<li>How to write a classified ad that will get noticed</li>
<li>How to record a professional looking video with your smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1-minute explainer video</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The building of El Paso’s new baseball stadium</li>
<li>How did the Asarco smokestacks get demolished?</li>
<li>Why is global climate change happening?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Staff roundup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Book of the month by a local author from our book page editor</li>
<li>5 can’t miss things to do in El Paso this weekend from our entertainment editor</li>
<li>5 best sports tweets this week</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quiz</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What happened in El Paso this week? 10-question quiz</li>
<li>How well do you know El Paso? 100-question quiz with prizes</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Beyond those, it would be interesting to explore a long-form course on a subject of interest to our readers that would keep them coming back, week after week, familiarizing them with our newsroom. For example, we could do a 10-part El Paso history series with our staff librarian. </span></p>
<h1><strong>Trend 3: Comments<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Webb also had some interesting things to say about the future of reader comments on news sites. She says, as they exist today, comments are not adding value to our product and are a distraction, and gave some horrifying examples to prove her point.</p>
<p>To remedy this, she suggested that news organizations create comment systems that are similar to a cocktail party — only include comments from people that I know or &#8220;find fascinating,&#8221; with the ability to invite others into the conversation.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/LittleGuyInATie" target="_blank">Lucas</a> and I had a discussion about this after the talk. He said, &#8220;Wouldn’t it get boring after awhile, to hear the same old voices in the comment forum?&#8221; I disagreed, thinking commenting on our site could benefit from some curation. Friends and &#8220;top commenters&#8221; could move to the top, with all others after that. Our conversation was a reminder that different people want different things from comments, and it&#8217;s hard to make one system that fits them all.</p>
<p>I checked out a few of the sites that Webb mentioned to see what the cutting edge of commenting technology looks like. <a href="http://gawker.com">Gawker</a> makes you create a <a href="http://kinja.com/" target="_blank">Kinja</a> account (and therefore, a blog) in order for you to comment. They also <a href="http://gawker.com/crime-in-the-hamptons-is-exactly-like-youd-expect-1457278259">inform you when the author of the article is participating</a> (a great idea, I thought). <a href="http://qz.com/">Quartz</a> allows you to annotate in the margins of an article. I was impressed at the look of it, though I wonder if it is too much work for the average reader to click on each paragraph rather than just see all the comments at one glance. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> has three comment views – All, Reader Picks and NYT picks. Though not in Webb&#8217;s presentation, I also took a look at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post</a>, where a &#8220;Community Pundits&#8221; comment appears at the top of the comments section. After that you can choose between Highlighted, Most Recent, Oldest and Most Faved comment views.</p>
<p>My dream comment looks like this (click photo to enlarge):<br />
<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4828" alt="comment_system" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg" width="1134" height="642" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You must sign in, preferably with a social media account tied to your real name. No anonymous commenting.</li>
<li>Readers can comment anywhere in the article, including at the end if they want to write something long.</li>
<li>Readers would have the option to view comments, or not, through options on a floating toolbar on the side of the page. (I’m envisioning something like VH1’s old <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156226/" target="_blank">Pop Up Videos</a> as what the comments might look like.)</li>
<li>Comments from my friends on social media, most popular commenters and the author of the post are color-coded and you could choose to view only those comments if you wish.</li>
<li>A sophisticated algorithm sorts all this out and a real person does not make a full-time job out of filtering comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know, it’s a lot to ask. I think comment forums are one of the trickiest aspects of our site to manage. How do we encourage comments that are fun and insightful that will enhance readers&#8217; engagement with our content? On the other hand, how do we make it so that comments are not a distraction from the content itself? And how do we keep all those trolls away? It&#8217;s a delicate balance and I think more experimentation is a great trend.</p>
<p>Zack Harold recently wrote about <a title="Want to improve your online comments? Don’t feed the trolls" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/11/05/improve-online-comments-feed-trolls/" target="_blank">how to deal with online trolls</a> from a different ONA13 session.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 4: Data<br />
</strong></h1>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Webb says 2014 is the year data goes completely mainstream. She said everyone in the newsroom needs to get experience with data, now.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately she didn’t get to spend too much time on this. But she is right.</p>
<p>Data was a <em>HUGE</em> topic at ONA13. Here are some of the sessions that focused on data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/closing-the-digital-and-data-divide/#.UnfPNETPdJ8">Closing the Digital and Data Divide: Data Journalism in Developing Countries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">Storytelling with Data</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">I Need Data for My Story. Help.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/tower-of-babel-problem/">Data Journalism: The Tower of Babel Problem</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/your-datas-showing/#.UnfPr0TPdJ8">&#8220;Ha, Your Data&#8217;s Showing&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Big Data, Little Newsroom</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Building Your First Data Driven Map with Tile Mill</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/friday-lunch-keynote/#.UnfP30TPdJ8">ONA13 keynote</a> was delivered by Nate Silver of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">fivethirtyeight.com</a>.</p>
<p>So, what needs to happen for newsrooms to fully embrace data journalism?</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two different classes of people in a newsroom and both of them need help:</p>
<p>First, we need to bring people who don’t usually deal with data visualization into the fold and get them to think in a &#8220;data&#8221; mindset. We need to fundamentally rewire the way journalists think about their stories. Data is an integral way of telling a story, especially in a digital format. Many journalists still aren&#8217;t getting it.</p>
<p>But I would argue that the most skilled of the data journalists in smaller newsrooms face a whole slew of problems, too. How many of us are trained statisticians? How do we know how to &#8220;clean&#8221; data and interpret it correctly? How many of us are experienced at coding? One of the biggest obstacles we face is that we lack the manpower to take on big projects. <a href="https://github.com/DFMdata?tab=members" target="_blank">DFM’s data team</a> is a great idea in this respect. They provide professional help for the more ambitious projects we want to take on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting journey digging into just a few technology trends that Webb identified in her crystal ball (I&#8217;m still pondering Google Glass and drones). Webb is someone I&#8217;m definitely going to keep an eye on in the next few years (on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/WebbMedia">@WebbMedia</a>). Who can say which of her trends will end up being &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; but we&#8217;re sure to hear more about everything she talked about.</p>
<p>The unknown can be scary but I&#8217;m also excited about the possibilities for the future of journalism.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Salt-N-Pepa. Cat gifs. Cronuts. Ryan Gosling. PB&amp;J.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Looking for a common theme? </span>Each of these items made an appearance in some form or another at <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/fasttrack-video-1/#.UnQ2XJRgaPs" target="_blank">ONA13&#8242;s Fast Track Video Workshop</a>, which I attended.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">With a focus on long-form video, the techniques I learned about in this session can help improve the <a href="http://www.tout.com/u/kimguim" target="_blank">Touts</a> and other video projects we produce from our newsrooms across Digital First Media. </span>I&#8217;m no pro when it comes to video, but I am excited to begin applying what I learned from this workshop. H<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">ere are the 7 tips that can take our video game to the next level (pun intended):</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. Remember the &#8216;Rule of Thirds&#8217;<br />
</span></strong>Just like when taking a good photo, the focal point of each video shot should be on a grid based on thirds.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. Do not cross the line of action<br />
</span></strong>The line of action is the line of action — do not cross it. Keep the camera on one side of the subject.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Capture <a href="http://video.digitalnewsroom.org/index.php/onepager-five-shot-video-checklist/">5 key shots</a> for every video</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Closeup of the hands — What is the subject doing?</li>
<li>Closeup of the face — Be in their face</li>
<li>Wide shot — Set the scene with the environment shot</li>
<li>Over the shoulder — Get the subject’s point-of-view</li>
<li>Unusual or alternative angle — What else should the audience know?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4. Hold for 10 seconds<br />
</span></strong>Ten seconds is just that — 10 seconds. Hold each shot for 10 seconds, which allows footage that can be edited out. But remember to keep the camera steady.</p>
<p>Need help keeping your camera steady? Buy a tripod. Even a cheap one will help with stability. <a href="http://video.digitalnewsroom.org/index.php/onepager-video-field-equipment/">Being equipped correctly is important.</a></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">5. Audio is extremely important<br />
</span></strong>Audio is key. Be aware of background noise. What good is an interview if you can’t hear what someone is saying?</p>
<p>Invest in earphones or earbuds and use them.</p>
<p>And if possible, a separate mic is always better. If you have one that you can use, it&#8217;s important that you remain in control of it. Do not let the subject hold it.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="http://video.digitalnewsroom.org/index.php/onepager-audio-checklist-for-video/">extra tips</a> straight from the source.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">6. Interviewing<br />
</span></strong>Many of us think we’ve got this, and many of us do. But remember that interviews take a very different dynamic on camera than they do with a notebook. Here are some pointers for recording video interviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from yes/no questions. Ask open-ended questions. Long questions are good. Description is good.</li>
<li>Smile and nod to engage with the subject while they are talking. But avoid any oohs and aaahs, as those are difficult to edit out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. And this is the most important part</strong><br />
Ultimately, have fun while doing it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-150x150.gif" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tout Bout Logo" /></p><p><img class="alignright  wp-image-3395" alt="Tout Bout Logo" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout.gif" width="180" height="181" /></p>
<p>Thanks to the dozens of Digital First Media journalists who <a title="Enter now for the September Tout Bout" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/09/september-tout-bout/" target="_blank">submitted an entry in this month&#8217;s Tout Bout</a>. Our panel has watched them all and selected a new batch of finalists for you to vote on below.</p>
<p>Remember, there are two categories – videos shot with the Tout mobile app and videos that were not shot on mobile, but were distributed with Tout. The finalists for each category were selected based on news value, production quality and, most importantly, creativity. Now it’s up to you to decide which Tout deserves the $200 and $100 prize, respectively. Review the finalist videos below, cast your vote at the bottom, and share your vote with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23toutbout" target="_blank">#ToutBout</a>. The voting deadline is Mon., Sept. 30.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATED 9/30</strong>: Voting is now closed. The winners will be announced this week on Inside Thunderdome.</em></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> After this month&#8217;s Bout, the competition will be held quarterly, rather than monthly. More details to come after we declare this month&#8217;s winners, so stay tuned here at Inside Thunderdome.</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE CATEGORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://twitter.com/cmijs" target="_blank">Catherine Bowen Mijs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrosenbaum" target="_blank">Joel Rosenbaum</a> and <a href="mailto: gtrott@thereporter.com" target="_blank">Greg Trott</a>, The Reporter</strong><br />
&#8220;This Tout from the scene of a 7-alarm fire that destroyed several homes and burned 40 acres in Fairfield on Aug. 27, along with Touts by staff photographers Joel Rosenbaum and Greg Trott, helped us to tell the story in a way that words and still photos just couldn&#8217;t. As we posted each breaking Tout, more and more people began to contact us including all the Bay Area television stations that wanted our footage!&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinMiller1883" target="_blank">Robin Miller</a></p>

</a></strong>&#8220;This Tout submission includes <a href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2013/08/31/blotter/doc522099e9d5459169277550.txt?viewmode=fullstory" target="_blank">four videos as a package</a> on a tragedy in a small town. Two teens were killed and two others injured in a car accident a week before school began. The boys were on the football team and on their way to a practice. I&#8217;m submitting the package because they appeared on our website long before the story did and covered all angles of the accident from eyewitnesses to school officials. The Daily Freeman had the story long before any other media outlet, and the Touts were the tools we used to get the details out to our readers. The videos were well-viewed, getting thousands of hits as a package. They were shot on location and edited on my iPhone (in my car).&#8221; &#8211; Paula Mitchell</p>

</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#8220;Shows high school game action of an athletic catch by player. The shooter didn&#8217;t flinch and move away from the action and captures the play long enough for us to catch the receiver diving into the end zone after catching a ball while being tightly defended.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertMeeksPT" target="_blank">Robert Meeks</a></span></p>

<p><strong>1. <a href="https://twitter.com/cineclark" target="_blank">Clark Coleman, Monterey Herald</a><br />
</strong>&#8220;I am nominating this Tout because it was filmed and edited to tell a cohesive story in 45 seconds. It was used in conjunction with a features story to tease a local film festival. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This Tout stands out among other Touts because more attention was put into the production value.&#8221; &#8211; Clark Coleman</span></p>

</strong>&#8220;Boeing Co. senior manager Dave Marendino has worked on the C-17 program since the first military plane took off from its East Long Beach ramp more than 20 years ago. Like many longtime employees, Marendino takes pride in delivering the plane for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions. The recent delivery of the final C-17 to the U.S. Air Force was emotional for many, so Marendino&#8217;s farewell to the plane as it leaves Long Beach for Charleston, S.C. was a bittersweet moment I wanted to capture. Special thanks to Robert Meeks for his help on this video.&#8221; &#8211; Karen Robes Meeks</p>
