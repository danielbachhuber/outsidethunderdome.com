				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Robert-Mills-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Robert Mills" /></p><p><a title="Robert Mills" href="https://twitter.com/Robert_Mills">Robert Mills</a> of the Lowell Sun wins the DFMie as the best staff blogger of Digital First Media.</p>
<p>His editor&#8217;s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rob Mills, The Sun&#8217;s night police reporter, gets it. His <a title="Police Line" href="http://blogs.lowellsun.com/policeline/">Police Line</a> blog is not a dumping ground for breaking news. Mills adds photos, edits and embeds his own video, and provides added detail and context to his work. He also engages his followers in the behind-the-scenes ethical questions that he encounters. Our readers have responded; his blog is the most read on <a href="http://lowellsun.com">lowellsun.com</a> by a factor of four or five. He is a worthy candidate for this award.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DFMie judges agreed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our pick is Police Line, from the Lowell Sun. It&#8217;s good, passionate and tireless work from the perspective of a veteran reporter who conveys his journalistic and human values, as well as his love for the community he covers. The blog is rich with an unusual level of detail and photos that put the reader right at the scene. One notable recent post even included a well-written account of an accident sent in by a 13-year-old resident who responded to the scene along with police, fire and ambulance. Talk about user-generated content. We also appreciated the spurs for community action at the end of each post. Police Line is worth a regular visit even if you don&#8217;t live in the Lowell, Mass., area.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for staff blogger were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="Evan Brandt" href="https://twitter.com/pottstownnews">Evan Brandt</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., for his <a title="Evan Brandt's Digital Notebook" href="http://evan-brandt.blogspot.com/2012/05/welfare-for-white-and-wealthy.html">Digital Notebook</a>, where he posted daily, 365 posts in 2012. Brandt was also a finalist for Mid-Sized Daily Journalist of the Year.</span></li>
<li><a title="Fred J. Robledo" href="https://twitter.com/SGVNSports">Fred Robledo</a>, Local Sports Editor for the Los Angeles News Group for his <a title="Fred J. Robledo on Prep Sports" href="http://www.insidesocal.com/tribpreps/2012/08/24/friday-night-co-1/">San Gabriel Valley Tribune  prep sports blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mills has been at The Sun since Sept. 9, 2002. He has worked for MediaNews Group since Jan. 24, 2000, first at the Lebanon Daily News, and then at the Fitchburg Sentinel. He attended Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa., as a journalism major, but left a semester early to go to work in Lebanon.</p>
<p>He has a 10-month-old daughter Charlotte Mills and lives in Lowell with his girlfriend Giovanna Aviles. &#8220;I&#8217;m a stay-at-home dad by day, and then a crime reporter at night. I love the night shift (4 to midnight) because it means I&#8217;m home with my daughter each day.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">&#8220;Sad as it usually is, I love reporting on crime and spot news,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;I think we need to confront our readers with the sad reality that occurs most days in our cities, and I think graphic reporting on the violence and tragedy that is part of this beat is the best way to help our society understand and deal with the issues. &#8230; </span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">I think I&#8217;m privileged to tell the stories of people and incidents that many people would like to ignore.&#8221;</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Kim-Guimarin-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Kim Guimarin" /></p><p>DFMie judges chose <a title="Kim Guimarin" href="https://twitter.com/KimGuim">Kim Guimarin</a>, senior editor for the Los Angeles News Group, as Assigning Editor of the Year for Digital First Media.</p>
<p>LANG Executive Editor Michael Anastasi nominated Guimarin for the honor:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the ever-shifting culture of journalism these days, titles often don&#8217;t reflect the work that falls on the name in front of them. In Kim&#8217;s case, this is certainly true. Ever the champion of doing things better — and with a larger digital presence — than we&#8217;ve done them before, Kim has been the driving force behind the success of three LANG newsrooms.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s stimulating the planning process, as in the case of last year&#8217;s event coverage of the Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival and the Route 66 Rendezvous; or motivating follow-up coverage on a story we maybe didn&#8217;t push as hard out of the gate, Kim&#8217;s graceful management of three very different teams has kept LANG&#8217;s Inland group at the forefront of digital journalism.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve created this <a title="Projects led by Kim Guimarin" href="http://storify.com/GNAdv/inland-empire-newsrooms-showcase-multimedia-approa">Storify to showcase some of the varied projects she led in 2012</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">The DFMies judges explained why they chose her:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The package of stories her editors submitted exudes creativity and digital dexterity. Notably, the piece on Jo-Ann Fabrics and a staffer denied leave while undergoing chemotherapy relied on crowd-sourcing for its rendering, taking a seemingly incremental story and giving it greater cosmic importance. That is the hallmark of solid and relevant local journalism.</p>
<p>Further, the blogs and live coverage of the Route 66 Rendezvous and the Coachella Music and Arts Festival were great fun and engaged readers. These pieces do not have her byline on them but, as great assignment editors can attest, her mark is all over them and she should be proud.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Assigning Editor of the Year were <a title="Helen Bennett" href="https://twitter.com/newsgirlct">Helen Bennett</a> of the New Haven Register and <a title="Mark Conley" href="https://twitter.com/MarkConley">Mark Conley</a> of the Bay Area News Group.<span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem"> </span></p>
<p>Guimarin works closely with the inland cluster of papers. She also oversees the photography staff for LANG. She has been working with the group for nine years. She attended Humboldt State University where she received her degree in journalism and mass communication.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Brian-Charles-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Brian Charles" /></p><div id="attachment_3330" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/brian-charles-named-journalist-year-dfm-mid-sized-dailies/brian-charles/" rel="attachment wp-att-3330"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3330" alt="Brian Charles" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Brian-Charles-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brian Charles</p></div>
<p><a title="Brian Charles" href="https://twitter.com/JBrianCharles">Brian Charles</a> of the Pasadena Star-News is the Journalist of the Year for Digital First Media&#8217;s newsrooms publishing mid-sized dailies.</p>
<p>Charles is recognized for his coverage of the Pasadena police. He is one of four finalists for Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. That winner will be announced in September, when DFMie winners will be honored in Denver.</p>
<p>His editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reporter Brian Charles is a rising star in the Los Angeles News Group and DFM. His year-long coverage of the officer-involved <a title="Questions remain in the shooting of Kendrec McDade" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_22857548/one-year-later-questions-remain-shooting-death-kendrec?IADID=Search-www.pasadenastarnews.com-www.pasadenastarnews.com">shooting of an unarmed, black teenager named Kendrec McDade by Pasadena police officers</a> in pursuit of a robbery suspect uncovered <a title="More allegations come forward in Pasadena police probe" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_22904838">questionable patterns and practices in the city&#8217;s homicide bureau</a>. It also led defense attorneys, former police officers and citizens to come forward with information that helped him to shine even more light on these patterns and practices.</p>
<p>Brian&#8217;s follow-up reporting led to the suspension of one detective and the demotion of another. More importantly, his reporting has prompted investigations by the FBI and Los Angeles County Office of Independent Review into the Pasadena Police Department and its homicide bureau. Those probes, which are continuing, already have resulted in a mistrial in a homicide case where it was discovered that two police officers intimidated a witness and hid exculpatory evidence. The Los Angeles County District Attorney&#8217;s Office is frantically examining other cases involving those two Pasadena police officers.</p>
<p>As a young father, it would have been easy for Brian to have stopped digging when he uncovered some of this information. Some segments of law enforcement turned up the heat on him to leave well enough alone. But despite that, he doggedly carried on and continued to seek the truth. His search is far from over, but already it has been noticed at the city, county, state and federal levels.</p>
<p>What makes Brian&#8217;s work even more impressive is he had much more on his plate than simply reporting on the Pasadena Police Department. As the lead writer in the Star-News&#8217; newsroom, Brian covered Pasadena City Hall and politics this past year. It was all part of his beat, one that was bigger than most in LANG. And anytime Editor Frank Girardot needed somebody to jump on a breaking news story, Brian usually got the call and eagerly gave it his all. He also was among the reporters who contributed to LANG&#8217;s Christopher Dorner coverage.</p>
<p>Brian has engaged in the sort of reporting that stands as an example to other local journalists seeking a deeper understanding of their community and its dynamics. For those reasons I believe Brian should be the Journalist of the Year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges concurred:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Charles of the Pasadena Star-News is to be commended for staying on top of the death of an unarmed man by Pasadena police officers. His stories are clear, accessible and exhaustively reported. Others have noticed: One detective was suspended, another demoted, and an investigation has been launched. His coverage and writing voice have clearly matured and he renders updates on this important story with authority and accountability. Like many reporters at a paper of this size, Brian juggles his commitment to this story among many others. His juggling act is notable and, in one of the most competitive media environments in the world, he embodies the best of local journalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Journalist of the Year in mid-sized dailies were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="J.M. Brown" href="https://twitter.com/jmbrownreports">J.M. Brown</a> of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, for a <a title="J.M. Brown project on desalination" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/desal/ci_21646511">project on water desalination</a>.</span></li>
<li><a title="Pottstown News" href="https://twitter.com/pottstownnews">Evan Brandt</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., who was also a finalist for the <a title="Robert Mills Wins DFMie as Top Staff Blogger" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/lowell-sun/robert-mills-wins-dfmie-top-staff-blogger/">DFMie for best staff blogger</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A native New Yorker, Brian Charles graduated from the State University of New York at Purchase in 2005. He moved to California and began working in community news in 2006, starting at a rural weekly before moving to a small daily in 2008. In 2009, he was hired by the Pasadena Star-News to cover education, politics and breaking news. His work as a journalist has been recognized by the California Newspaper Publishing Association and in 2009 he won an Associated Press award for coverage of an on-campus suicide at a Los Angeles-area high school.</p>
<p>In March, Charles was promoted to a staff position the Daily Breeze, also a part of the Los Angeles News Group.</p>
<p>Charles lives in South Pasadena, with his wife, Michelle, and daughter, Natalie.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">She is one of four finalists for Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. That winner will be announced in September at a program honoring DFMie winners in Denver.</span></p>
<p>DFMie judges were enthusiastic in their praise for Momberger:</p>
<blockquote><p>The notion of the newspaper as the pillar of the community is difficult to maintain in an age of alternative news sources and increasing skepticism toward the news media. Toni Momberger has beaten the odds with her leadership at the Redlands Daily Facts. She wins this award, in part, for fostering a newsroom culture that has deep roots in the community it covers. She&#8217;s also a committed journalist, taking a balanced approach to coverage. From &#8220;meet the editor&#8221; days to a <a title="Mexican history in Redlands needs recording" href="http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/ci_20197806/mexican-history-redlands-needs-recording">column on the Mexican history of Redlands</a> to a weekly series of video interviews for the city&#8217;s 125th anniversary, Momberger has demonstrated a deep commitment to the place her newspaper covers &#8212; an approach that surely pays dividends in reader loyalty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nomination by Michael Anastasi, Executive Editor of the Los Angeles News Group, details the many ways Momberger serves her community:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toni Momberger epitomizes the best of small-daily journalism.</p>
<p>The hard-charging, passionate and caring editor of the Redlands Daily Facts, Toni believes in her community, believes in the people of her community and believes with every bit of her soul that the news organization&#8217;s most important mission is to serve the community.</p>
<p>Jim Brady still talks about the day he spent with Toni, as she excitedly drove him throughout the town and recited tales of community lore that had taken place decades before she was even born.</p>
<p>I remember the day I suggested we go to a Starbucks to talk. She refused &#8212; only a locally-owned coffee shop was acceptable.</p>
<p>Yet Toni is far from a community cheerleader. She is a newswoman. She reports the bad and the good and ensures her staff seeks both. She is committed to her community, and strives, as all good editors should, to improve it by providing readers with news, context and insight on important issues and events.</p>
<p>She has exacting standards for her staff. Working at the Daily Facts is hard work, as each member of the newsroom will tell you. In this, Toni leads by example, often working long hours to cover a story or events herself or to represent the newspaper at community events after hours.</p>
<p>She guards the town&#8217;s memory, and in many ways, she is the town&#8217;s memory and its conscience.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of her day-in, day-out contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">She goes to dress rehearsals of the school plays and reviews them before opening night.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">She has partnered with the town&#8217;s school newspapers, and periodically takes over the journalism classes at Redlands High School, Redlands East Valley High School and Moore Middle School; She teaches the entire journalism course at the Grove charter school as a volunteer.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">She started a Faith page, and put the churches in town in a rotation to provide a column (it works out to about one per year per church.) Also the RDF now runs a church calendar and news of happenings on that page.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">She started a personal column where she attends, participates in or does a ride-along on something anyone in Redlands may do, and she tells readers what it&#8217;s like.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">She started brown bag lunches with journalism lessons and lunch in the former composing room; she partnered with the community foundation for funding to pay for speakers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">She partnered with the senior communities to give Redlands Daily Facts historical tours of the town. They come pick her up in their van and she directs the driver while spouting fun facts.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">Once a month or so she bakes cookies or cupcakes and declares Meet-the-Editor Day. She puts out the word through social media that she&#8217;s trying to meet everyone in town. &#8220;If I haven&#8217;t met you yet, come into my office and tell me your story.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714">At the end of 2012 she launched a project wherein she interviews someone every week on video. This is to commemorate the city&#8217;s 125th anniversary. She teamed with the city&#8217;s videographer to get the stories and memories from people who either impacted or are experts on the fabric of the town&#8217;s history.</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px">The other finalist for Small-Daily Journalist of the Year is <a title="Neal Goswami" href="https://twitter.com/nealgoswami">Neal Goswami</a>, nominated for several stories he wrote in 2012. He has since been promoted to Senior Staff Writer and Social Media Editor.</span></p>
<p>Momberger is editor in the town where she was born 43 years ago. &#8220;The doctor who delivered me sits next to me in Rotary Club meetings,&#8221; Momberger said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a town where people stay. They love their history and the Facts plays a big role in the community. I am the first native Redlander to run this paper since the Moore family in the founding years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is a graduate of the University of Colorado at Boulder, with a degree in linguistics. Her first real newspaper job was at the Boulder Daily Camera as a news compositor.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">After the Sandy Hook massacre, she wrote a <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/ci_22196210">column about her emotional reaction as a mother</a>. Her blog is <a title="Stories O' Mine" href="http://storiesomine.wordpress.com/">Stories O&#8217; Mine</a>. </span></p>

<p><a title="Megan Quinn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/meganquinncolorado">Megan Quinn</a> of the Broomfield Enterprise wins the DFMie as Digital First Media&#8217;s Journalist of the Year for newsrooms that don&#8217;t publish daily in print.</p>
<p>The nomination from Editor Julie Baxter detailed Quinn&#8217;s 2012 performance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Megan is a workhorse. Being the only staff writer for a twice-weekly requires that, but her work shines and serves Broomfield residents well. We are the primary news source in Broomfield and Megan does an excellent job of keeping folks in the know on issues large and small. The community and the Enterprise is lucky to have her.</p></blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">DFMie judges explained why they chose Quinn:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Megan Quinn, notably on her day off, dug up details on a relationship between a murder victim—a woman who worked at a local Saab dealership—and the suspect, something police were reticent to comment on. The shoe-leather quality of her reporting is noteworthy and especially remarkable given the fact that she is the Broomfield Enterprise&#8217;s only staff writer. Quinn&#8217;s reporting on sensitive issues was sympathetic to both sides and offered context for a delicate news event. She balanced outside experts with family and witness testimony well to create a nuanced look at a tragic event in such a way that could help the community understand both what happened that day, and how it fits into national discussions surrounding gun control and mental health.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Non-Daily Journalist of the Year were <a title="Michael Guardabascio" href="https://twitter.com/Guardabascio">Michael Guardabascio</a>, sports editor of the Gazettes in the Los Angeles News Group, and <a title="Linda Finarelli" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/linda-finarelli/a/6a0/463">Linda Finarelli</a>, a reporter for Montgomery County Media in Montgomery County, Pa.</p>
<p>Megan Quinn is a community reporter who has spent the past year covering life in Broomfield, Colo., for the Broomfield Enterprise. She also covers religion for the Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p>Quinn, who got her journalism degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has worked for several publications across the Front Range including Colorado Community Media and the the Loveland Reporter-Herald. Quinn is an active runner, swimmer, homebrewer and birdwatcher who can’t pass up a beautiful day outside.</p>
