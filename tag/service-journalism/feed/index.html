				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-8.57.44-AM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 8.57.44 AM" /></p><p>As gun control and gun-owners&#8217; rights became one of the hottest issues in the nation, <a title="Josh Richman" href="https://twitter.com/Josh_Richman">Josh Richman</a> examined California&#8217;s long history of gun control. His thorough reporting won the January DFMie for the Bay Area News Group.</p>
<p>Managing Editor/Content Bert Robinson explained the project in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>California occupies an interesting place in the gun control debate &#8212; much of what&#8217;s being debated on a national level, from the assault weapons ban to enhanced background checks to a limit on the size of ammunition magazines &#8212; is already the law here. BANG political reporter Josh Richman is capitalizing on the California experience, writing about national gun control issues with the benefit of California&#8217;s triumphs and struggles. In mid January, he jumped on one of the biggest issues that Congress must tackle &#8212; one, frankly, that California has never really solved: <a title="Assault weapons: What are they and should they be banned?" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_22396050">How do you define an assault weapon</a>?</p>
<p>Josh&#8217;s story plumbed the history of the California law, and an accompanying <a title="Assault rifle graphic" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/politics-government/ci_22398189">graphic</a> (below) by Chuck Todd and Karl Kahler showed where California ended up and how that works in practice (not as logically as we might wish).</p>
<p>Josh&#8217;s second piece, on Jan. 31, examined <a title="California's gun background-check system could be national model" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22483537">California&#8217;s background check system</a>, showing how much more rigorous it is than the current national model. Josh dug up numbers on how often applicants fail the background check &#8212; not often, as it turns out, but more often in California than elsewhere. Another sharp graphic, this time by Doug Griswold, walks readers through the way the system works.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The judges &#8212; winners of December DFMies &#8212; praised the results:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The timely stories do California readers a service by explaining the state&#8217;s laws and their effectiveness in a fairhanded manner &#8212; a position that&#8217;s pretty hard to achieve with this heated issue. The accompanying graphics are interesting and helpful. The stories were inspired by national headlines but benefited from good research, experience and observation.</p>
<p>They took a very newsy national story and found a way to localize it in an informative and interesting way. Although a lot of people are aware of the gun debate, many people don&#8217;t know what the different types of guns look like. The graphic adds a visual element to the story while also offering more information. The in-depth analysis in both stories offered a lot detail about gun laws that isn&#8217;t available in most of the national stories on the topic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>

<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The work is both explanatory and investigative and represents vital public service to his readers. He provided them with solid, in-depth, factual information about a raging debate marked by inaccuracies and emotional arguments on all sides. Josh cuts through that with good, useful information.</p>
<p>I find his work an example of journalism at its best. I learned a lot about the issue from reading Josh&#8217;s stories and from the excellent graphic that accompanied one of them. I will be showing this work to some of my own staff members in hopes that our readers can benefit from similar stories.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other BANG finalists for January were Mark Conley&#8217;s <a title="San Francisco 49ers coverage" href="www.mercurynews.com/49ers">pre-Super Bowl coverage of the San Francisco 49ers</a> and Mike Murphy and Ann Tatko-Peterson for their internal reports on digital traffic, with tips on what&#8217;s working well.</p>
