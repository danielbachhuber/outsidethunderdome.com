<p><a title="LauraAmato" href="https://twitter.com/LauraAmato">Amato</a> has been working at The Record in Troy, New York for the past two and half years, covering everything from high school sports to New York Giants training camp. A 2011 graduate of St. Johns University with a degree in journalism, Amato has spent her time at The Record building an audience both in print and online.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Over the past two years, Amato has found the benefits of digital journalism and how building a social media presence can help create an audience. She is now the new college sports reporter at The Record and while the beat has changed she hopes to continue working in the digital field.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/YDR-DFMIE-SPORTS-TEAM-PHOTO-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="(Clockwise, from top) Penn State football beat reporter Frank Bodani, visuals assistant manager Brad Jennings, sports reporter Jim Seip and photographer Chris Dunn show the tools they use to conduct award-winning coverage of Penn State football games. Taken Thursday, March 13, 2014, in the York Daily Record/Sunday News photo studio." /></p><p><strong>Frank Bodani</strong>, <strong>Chris Dunn</strong>, <strong>Brad Jennings</strong> and <strong>Jim Seip</strong> of the York Daily Record won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Sports Journalism DFMie for large newsrooms</a>.</p>
<p>The foursome collaborated on coverage of Penn State&#8217;s home football game against Nebraska. The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Penn State football has long been one of our most popular beats, so we throw everything we can at our gameday coverage &#8212; senior day in this case. Our team of multiplatform journalists engages our audience on social media hours before the game, provides <a href="http://mediacenter.ydr.com/2013/11/23/photos-penn-state-loses-23-20-in-1ot-to-nebraska/#1">photo</a> and video glimpses behind the scenes and helps satisfy avid fans looking for that second-screen experience. We share photos nearly in real-time from the sidelines, Tout player interviews after the game, and wrap up a 12-hour experience with in-depth stories and a postgame highlights and analysis video. And we show a little personality along the way.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nomination included a <a title="Storify of York Daily Record's Penn State-Nebraska coverage" href="http://storify.com/bradjennings9/ydr-live-coverage-at-penn-state-senior-day-game">Storify to showcase the staff&#8217;s video, photo and social media coverage of the game</a>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Judges&#8217; comments:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The York Daily Record’s game day coverage was the ideal combination of innovation and breadth in using different media to tell the same story. The reporters’ use of social media to provide updates, color, images and video while engaging with readers and players was a great complement for those watching the game or casually looking for an update.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same group was also a finalist for the Live Coverage DFMie. This is one of four DFMies for the York Daily Record and one of seven for the Pennsylvania newsrooms.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.142857143rem; line-height: 1.846153846;">About Frank Bodani</span></h3>
<p><a title="Frank Bodani" href="https://twitter.com/@YDRPennState">Bodani</a> covers Penn State for the York Daily Record and gives this account of his career:</p>
<blockquote><p>I never would have imagined I would cover Penn State football for a living, certainly not for 20 seasons. I didn’t attend Penn State (Duquesne University, class of ’91), didn’t root for the Nittany Lions (all-Pittsburgh sports fan), didn’t begin my career in the sports department (general assignment, York Dispatch). But the beat grew on me quickly, especially the challenge of capturing the feel of each game day. I moved to the York Daily Record in 2004 in the same beat, which also included feature- and column-writing, and enterprise projects.</p>
<p>I always figured I had it pretty good. Where else can you can get paid to hike the Appalachian Trail? Or cover a New Year&#8217;s bowl game in sunny Florida?</p></blockquote>
<h3>About Chris Dunn</h3>
<p>Although she aspired to be a television news anchor at age 10, <a title="Chris Dunn" href="https://twitter.com/@christhedunn">Dunn</a> later realized she does not enunciate well and scrapped TV for a print journalism path. A hippie in New Mexico taught her photojournalism, and she was hooked.</p>
<p>A graduate of the Missouri School of Journalism, Dunn interned as a visual journalist at Washington Post Digital and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution before beginning her career in 2011 at the York Daily Record.</p>
<h3>About Brad Jennings</h3>
<p>In his 14 years at the York Daily Record, <a title="Brad Jennings" href="https://twitter.com/@bradjennings9">Jennings</a> weaved his way through positions in the news, sports and visual departments. He is Assistant Managing Editor for Presentation and Digital Innovation, leading an Emmy- and EPPY-winning multimedia staff.</p>
<p>A proud University of Delaware graduate, he occasionally gets to escape the dungeon of managerial meetings by telling video stories at Penn State games.</p>
<h3>About Jim Seip</h3>
<p><a title="Jim Seip" href="https://twitter.com/@JimSeip">Seip</a> has survived working alongside Bodani on the York Daily Record&#8217;s Penn State football beat since 2005, and has been a sportswriter in York since 2002.</p>
<p>A Bloomsburg University graduate, Seip also made stops at the The Post-Star (Glens Falls, N.Y.), Potomac News (Woodbridge, Va.), Gazette Newspapers (Gaithersburg, Md.) and Pottsville Republican (Pottsville, Pa.).</p>
<h3>Other finalists</h3>
<p>Other large-newsrooms finalists in sports were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Los Angeles News Group</strong> for its <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/dodgers2013">coverage of the Dodgers’ post-season run</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Kurt Kragthorpe</strong> of the Salt Lake Tribune for his “<a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/sports/56587468-77/lake-salt-angels-bees.html.csp">Seven Levels of Angels</a>” series about the Los Angeles Angels and their farm system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year the DFMies did not have separate categories for large and small newsrooms. <a title="Christopher James wins DFMie for sports journalism" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/berkshire-eagle/christopher-james-wins-dfmie-sports-journalism/">Christopher James, then of the Berkshire Eagle, won the 2013 Sports Journalism DFMie</a>.</p>

(AP Photo/Don Wright)" /></p><p>The Boys of Summer begin their march to the Fall Classic on the same day the fastest winter sport on ice begins its regular season.</p>
<p>Feeling seasonally challenged by that? Thunderdome is here to help.</p>
<p>The Major League Baseball postseason, and the National Hockey League regular season begin Oct. 1, and Thunderdome will be curating the most important and most interesting elements of both for the readers of <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-serve/" target="_blank">Digital First Media newsrooms</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4518" alt="mlb" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/mlb-300x132.jpg" width="300" height="132" /><strong>2013 MLB postseason coverage plans</strong></p>
<p>MLB&#8217;s playoffs open with a wild-card game on Oct. 1 and progress through the League Championship Series and World Series. Each weekday morning, Thunderdome will offer a postseason version of its <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_24205072" target="_blank">MLB Replay feature,</a> capturing not only the news of the day but the buzz as well, with photos, GIFs, tweets, video and more. It will also look forward to upcoming games. It&#8217;s one-stop shopping for your time-pressed readers who just want someone to hit the highlights for them.</p>
<p>As we approach the LCS and World Series, we will be rounding up writers from around Digital First Media properties for live chats. And for the most compelling games, we will be using <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a> to bring you action, reaction and insights as the events unfold. Such coverage will  be available for syndication to non-DFM media outlets as well, via the <a href="https://market.scribblelive.com/Events/Client/4809" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>We will distribute features and columns from our DFM properties who have a team in the hunt, including <a href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/" target="_blank">The Oakland Press</a> (Detroit Tigers), <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Daily News</a> (L.A. Dodgers), <a href="http://info.bayareanewsgroup.com/" target="_blank">Bay Area News Group</a> (Oakland A&#8217;s) and the <a href="http://www.news-herald.com/" target="_blank">News-Herald</a>/<a href="http://www.morningjournal.com/" target="_blank">Morning Journal</a> (Cleveland Indians).</p>
<p><strong>NHL regular season plans</strong></p>
<p>You may recall that late last year we tried a similar daily approach with hockey coverage, branded <a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/golf/ci_23297016/san-jose-sharks-win-kings-bruins-rangers-lundqvist" target="_blank">NHL Replay</a>. However, we saw a pretty low adoption rate for that offering, as well as a low adoption rate for our <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_22771156/nhl-live-chat" target="_blank">weekly NHL chat</a>. So this year, we will try a different approach.</p>
<p><a href="http://nhl.com"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/1/491/thumbs/wkue6hfkzqs2bnl0efw8sihf7.gif" width="150" height="100" /></a>Each weekday morning we will sift through the news of the previous night, looking for the fantastic plays, the quirky tidbits and the major news from the NHL that should appeal to sports fans in general. So we&#8217;ll move away from a hardcore insider approach to a broader tactic, and publish individual items that merit posting. Hopefully these are the ones that sports fans will be talking about, and hopefully this will work in your community whether you are identified as a hockey hotbed or not. And of course throughout the season we will be on the lookout to distribute the best hockey features produced by the DFM properties that do cover an NHL team.</p>

Users can scan the selections, see who’s favored and vote on who will win each game, or just use the expert advice as guidance for making their own picks. The writers also provide a “Lock of the Week” – their bet-the-mortgage-on-this-one pick – in Tout form, and some of them have found creative ways to make their selections. Check out the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_24014711/nfl-experts-picks" target="_blank">latest round of picks for week two</a>.</p>

<p>New picks for the upcoming weekend are released every Wednesday evening.</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy football live chat and column</strong><br />

They share the latest news on injuries and player transactions and take reader questions about which players should be in their starting lineup that week. The chat transcript also has shelf life up until Sunday’s kickoff. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/digital-first-media/ci_24064792/fantasy-football-2013-week-2-advice" target="_blank">Check out the replay of this week&#8217;s chat</a>.</p>

Check out Nowak&#8217;s column from week 1.</p>
<p>Dan doesn’t stop there – for those in the audience who aren’t into fantasy but have, shall we say, a vested interest in the outcome of NFL games, Dan offers a weekly “<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_24035164" target="_blank">Betting the NFL</a>” column that is available every Friday evening. In this column Dan makes his picks “against the spread.” Check out last week&#8217;s column.</p>
<p><strong>Coming soon: Heisman candidates</strong><br />
Trentonian editor <a href="https://twitter.com/trentonianozzy" target="_blank">Matthew Osborne</a>, a Heisman Trophy voter, offered a preseason look at this year’s Heisman candidates, and will be offering a weekly ranking of his top five contenders beginning in late September. This feature will be available each Sunday night.</p>
<p><strong>NFL Replays, gamers and more to come<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Throughout each week, we will share the best football features and breaking news from our properties covering the biggest teams and top players and programs in pro and college football. </span>We’ll be producing football content from Thunderdome as well, with features such as <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_24088195" target="_blank">NFL Replay</a> and interesting things curated from the Web.</p>
<p>It culminates in January with a national championship game at the Rose Bowl in warm-weather Pasadena, and a February Super Bowl in balmy (?) New Jersey.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll go along for the ride.</p>

<p><a title="Christopher James" href="https://twitter.com/becj2k">Christopher James</a> of the Berkshire Eagle wins the DFMie for sports journalism for his project on <a title="Concussions in football" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_21183781/concussions-footballs-trauma-center">concussions in football</a>.</p>
<p>His editors&#8217; nomination explains the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>In late 2011 and early 2012, before the death of retired NFL great Junior Seau, The Berkshire Eagle editors recognized that concussions could turn into the story of the year in football — and perhaps in the entire sports world. We assigned sports reporter Christopher James to <a title="Colleges: Medical staffs, less contact are keys in battle" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_21183773/colleges-medical-staffs-less-contact-are-keys-battle">analyze the issue</a> and look at how youth leagues and <a title="High schools: Coaches, players confront challenges" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_21183769/high-schools-coaches-players-confront-challenges">schools in the county</a> had addressed it. The result was a multi-story package that the <a title="APSE award winners" href="http://apsportseditors.org/newsletter/writing-winners-announced-for-2012-apse-contest/">Associated Press Sports Editors recognized as one of the 10 best stories of the year in 2012 in the explanatory journalism category</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why James won the DFMie:</p>
<blockquote><p>A difficult topic is presented in a readable, clear-headed manner. What could have been a clinical story was instead a vivid read. We think the impact here is high, as this equips players and parents with information that has long been lacking but will play an important role in important decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other sports finalists were :</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Brian Murphy" href="https://twitter.com/murphPPress">Brian Murphy</a> of the Pioneer Press for his story on a <a title="Vikings: How ex-GM Mike Lynn ..." href="http://www.twincities.com/vikings/ci_20917947/vikings-stadium-end-dome-means-end-suite-deal">sweetheart stadium deal that enriched former Minnesota Vikings General Manager Mike Lynn</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Kyle Goon" href="https://twitter.com/kylegoon">Kyle Goon</a> and <a title="Melinda Rogers" href="https://twitter.com/mrogers_utah">Melinda Rogers</a> of the Salt Lake Tribune for their stories on a <a title="Cottonwood benefactor built football program ..." href="http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=24474230&amp;itype=storyID">benefactor&#8217;s relationship to a high school football team</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>James has been with The Berkshire Eagle since 2010, serving as the sports department&#8217;s high school coordinator since 2011. Before The Eagle, James, 27, spent two years working as a sports writer at The Daily Times in Maryville, Tenn., just south of Knoxville.</p>
<p>He is a 2008 graduate of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. The Maine native was honored by the New England Newspaper and Press Association for a 2011 story on recruiting at small colleges.</p>
