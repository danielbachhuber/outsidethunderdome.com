Designer <a title="Samantha Dellinger" href="http://www.yorkblog.com/artist/">Samantha Dellinger</a> of the York Daily Record wins the DFMie for best print front page for her cover on the death of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.</p>
<p>Her editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samantha Dellinger’s “JoePa” page design sought to strike the right balance for an avid Penn State readership the day after Joe Paterno died, a major news story.</p>
<p>The image size and design simplicity project the story’s significance. The photo captures Paterno, unmistakable even from behind, in his element, but moving away toward brighter skies. (Paterno’s role in the Freeh Report was not yet known). Readers told us they appreciated our approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judge explained why the page was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>We chose Samantha Dellinger’s “JoePa” front-page design for its elegance and simplicity. Paterno, his back to the camera, looms larger than life in the setting of his beloved Penn State. His figure against a lively stadium fills the entire page, unencumbered by competing messages. For fan and critic alike, we imagine there was no bigger story that day, and the singular focus of this design captures that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for best print front page were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Bob Carville" href="https://twitter.com/bcarville">Bob Carville</a> of the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa., for his front page covering the theater massacre in Auroro, Colo.</li>
<li><a title="Tiffany Grandstaff" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tiffany-grandstaff/4/934/6bb">Tiffany Grandstaff</a> of the Bay Area News Group for her cover previewing a San Francisco 49ers playoff game.</li>
