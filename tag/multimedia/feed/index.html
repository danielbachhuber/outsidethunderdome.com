<p>The feature, which started an occasional travel series in the Life section, included a <a title="Destinations: Mohonk Mountain House ..." href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2013/01/27/life/doc51032d1a40826941632310.txt?viewmode=fullstory">story and video</a> by <a title="Paula Freeman" href="https://twitter.com/anchoratfreeman">Paula Mitchell</a>, a <a title="Mohonk Mountain House slideshow" href="http://storify.com/ivanlajara/mohonk-moutain-house">Storify slideshow</a> of and <a title="Mohonk Mountain House" href="http://pinterest.com/dailyfreeman/mohonk-mountain-house/">Pinterest Pinboard</a> of photos by <a title="Tania Barricklo" href="https://twitter.com/tbarricklo">Tania Barricklo</a> and full-screen <a title="Mohonk Mountain House on New Hive" href="http://newhive.com/ivanlajara/mohonk-mountain-house?q=%40ivanlajara">New Hive interactive</a> including a Google map and a Google Earth flyover video. <a title="Ivan Lajara" href="https://twitter.com/ivanlajara">Ivan Lajara</a> produced the interactive features of the package.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">Judges liked the creative use of multimedia elements:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The Daily Freeman&#8217;s piece about Mohonk Mountain House was an interesting feature with awesome digital presentation. Between the video, photos and interactive slideshow, I feel like I&#8217;ve taken a tour of the castle without leaving my desk. I love the New Hive slideshow. I&#8217;ve signed up for an account of my own just because it looked so cool.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was personally most inspired by the castle project &#8212; the extent of information provided and the unique tools they used. It&#8217;s very extensive and interesting, yet totally doable and attainable for the regular journalist. This shows all of us what we could be doing with our stories. I feel like this is a great example of the future of journalism. I am signing up for a NewHive account right now, which means it sparked some action in me, even though I am across the country. I think this should be the winner because it has the potential to inspire other journalists, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote><p>The story was well-written and colorful. While it could have used quotes from guests , everything else was there. The lede was engaging. She chose a great place to write about and included ample support for why this place has been voted the best. I really enjoyed how she included colorful history of the castle. The video was well done. As one commenter said, &#8220;It was extremely enjoyable.&#8221; You really got a sense of place, though the audio for the marketing person was low and one interview was backlit. Her intro and narration was professional. I really liked how the story included the Hive interactive slideshow and the Storify component. It&#8217;s a great example of finding fresh ways to use new platforms.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other Northeast finalists were Neal Goswami of the Bennington Banner for coverage of the <a title="Drug sweep nets 48 arrests" href="http://www.benningtonbanner.com/news/ci_22389842/drug-sweep-nets-48-one-biggest-roundups-state">largest drug bust in Vermont history</a> and the <a title="Oneida Daily Dispatch" href="http://oneidadispatch.com">Oneida Daily Dispatch</a> for its smooth transition from six-day print publication to three days (while also switching to the Saxotech content management system, a new Sunday edition, a print redesign and off-site editing and design in Torrington, Conn.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Reporter Danielle Lynch and Editor Phil Heron of the Delaware County Times won the January DFMie for the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster for reporting and editorials about the local gun-control issue.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-9.31.25-AM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 9.31.25 AM" /></p><p>Reporter <a title="Danielle Lynch" href="https://twitter.com/dmlreporter">Danielle Lynch</a> and Editor <a title="Phil Heron" href="https://twitter.com/philheron">Phil Heron</a> of the Delaware County Times won the January DFMie for the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster for reporting and editorials about the local gun-control issue. Heron explains in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>For January, we decided to focus on the gun conversation sweeping the country in the wake of the deadly shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn. Reporter Danielle Lynch set the tone with an <a title="Gun debate heats up again in Delco" href="http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2013/01/13/news/doc50f238e1824fc929924324.txt">enterprise story tracking spikes in both gun sales and permits to carry</a> in the county. We then decided to engage the public in our conversation. I offered a blog, <a title="Letter from the Editor: Gun debate is one that needs to continue" href="http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2013/01/27/opinion/doc5105fd6d62704810662234.txt">print column</a> and <a title="EDITORIAL: Gun violence conversation too important to put off" href="http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2013/01/23/news/doc5100b077d1fd0070844221.txt">editorial</a> on this key issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges praised the dual approach of reporting and commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lynch did a very comprehensive job of tracking down data (re: gun sales, concealed/carry permits and background checks) in Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Bucks counties. She was also thorough in including impact on the business community (gun shops, etc.) and perspective from the weapons-control community group. Most useful: on-the-record responses by U.S. senators, congressmen and state representatives &#8212; revealing where they stand on the issue, and how Newtown had triggered a shift in position for two of them. Congrats on extracting official statements from them on a volatile issue &#8212; not easy! Videos added another dimension. The editorial offered a nice summary of points, pro/con, and the &#8220;Letter From The Editor&#8221; was an engaging personal essay, which invited conversation. The tremendous response from the community &#8212; hundreds of comments &#8212; is proof of successful reader engagement. Congrats on tackling a timely and important issue in a way that reflected community values, and triggered a deeper debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The video from a gun shop/indoor range, Target Master, was well done &#8212; capturing a growing sense of popularity of guns accompanied by well-shot B-rolls and interviews with the store manager and a customer.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/delco-times-gun-debate-coverage-wins-dfmie-danielle-lynch-phil-heron/delco-guns/" rel="attachment wp-att-2093"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2093" alt="Delco guns" src="/content/uploads/2013/03/Delco-guns.jpg" width="349" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>Other finalists in the cluster were Karol Gress and Andrea Gillhooley of the Lebanon Daily News for their <a title="Where the Jobs Are" href="http://www.spundge.com/notebooks/8050/">Where the Jobs Are</a> digital project and Jenny DeHuff of the Times Herald in Norristown, Pa., for coverage the <a title="Parole board reverses ..." href="http://www.timesherald.com/article/20130123/NEWS01/130129807/0/SEARCH/parole-board-reverses-rafael-robb-decision">parole (and reversal of parole) for killer Rafael Robb</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Multimedia coverage of the Mavericks Invitational big wave surfing event in Half Moon Bay won the Northern California DFMie for the staff of the Santa Cruz Sentinel.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/i-7GxrjRC-L-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="i-7GxrjRC-L" /></p><p>Multimedia coverage of the <a title="Mavericks International coverage" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/mavs">Mavericks Invitational big wave surfing event</a> in Half Moon Bay won the Northern California DFMie for the staff of the Santa Cruz Sentinel.</p>
<p>Editor Don Miller said the coverage generated more than 100,000 page views, during one of the world&#8217;s most famous big wave surfing events, which included seven surfers from Santa Cruz, called on 48 hours notice. Coverage included a gallery of <a title="Mavericks International photos through the years" href="http://photos.santacruzsentinel.com/2013/01/18/mavericks-invitational-photos/">historical Mavericks photos</a>, a <a title="Liveblog of Mavericks International" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/mavs/ci_22402254/mavericks-invitational-2013-live-updates">liveblog of photos and updates</a>, collaboration with <a title="Santa Cruz Waves" href="http://www.santacruzwaves.com/galleries/the-mavericks-invitational-2013/">Santa Cruz Waves</a>, as well as a Storify and sports staff <a title="Santa Cruz native ..." href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_22416630/sc-native-peter-mel-charges-win-at-mavericks">coverage of the competition</a>.</p>
<p>Judges praised the surfing package:</p>
<blockquote><p>With glorious photos, an online community conversation and well-reported stories, this coverage seems to hit the Digital First Media target dead-on. As a reader, I felt pulled into the event and was able to enjoy it immensely, even after the fact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>I particularly liked the social elements the staff put together, including a Twitter feed of the surfing participants. The coverage was nicely packaged as one-stop-shopping for surfing enthusiasts. I also enjoyed a photo gallery of past incarnations of the event. Dynamic images displayed well. If you were a community member interested in this surfing event, the Sentinel had it all for you.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Santa Cruz Sentinel covered the surfing competition thoroughly both visually and through social engagement &#8212; as this event clearly required. Surfing is a very visual sport, and the  Sentinel did a great job of incorporating visual elements into its coverage. I thought the slideshow from past events was a good idea and provided readers a look back. Socially, the curation of posts into a Storify added to the story by offering different perspectives. I also thought the stream of tweets from surfers on the site&#8217;s sidebar was a nice touch. Incorporating Instagram added to the visual storytelling as well as the social engagement. In addition to finding every possible angle to cover this story digitally, the Sentinel staff covered it with a traditional news story. All of these story methods worked well together, and the Sentinel dominated its coverage of the surfing contest.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Marin Independent Journal and Santa Cruz Sentinel newsrooms operate as part of the NorCal cluster, but both are part of the Bay Area News Group for business purposes.</p>
