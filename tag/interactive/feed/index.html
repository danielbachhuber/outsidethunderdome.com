		<description><![CDATA[Ben Goessling and MaryJo Webster of the Pioneer Press win the DFMie for data journalism for their analysis of homeruns at Target Field, new home of the Minnesota Twins.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/target_field-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="target_field" /></p><p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bengoessling">Ben Goessling</a> and <a href="http://maryjowebster.pressfolios.com/">MaryJo Webster</a> of the Pioneer Press win the DFMie for data journalism for their <a href="http://www.twincities.com/1000/ci_20398152/target-field-factor-minnesota-twins-sluggers-constantly-battle">analysis of homeruns at Target Field</a>, new home of the Minnesota Twins.</p>
<p>Their editors’ nomination explains the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Making excuses for the Minnesota Twins is a regional pastime. But, as in any good sports town, the excuses often come backed with nothing but air.</p>
<p>So Twins Writer Ben Goessling and Computer-Assisted Reporting Editor MaryJo Webster applied hard data to a wisp of a theory: Perhaps the Twins&#8217; horrible home run production in their new ballpark had less to do with the oft-discussed &#8220;batter&#8217;s eye&#8221; and more to do with the wind.</p>
<p>Ben collected a massive amount of weather data and Twins’ data about home-run production. The result, paired with MaryJo&#8217;s knowledge, was a smart, interactive look at the topic that generated buzz among fans and pundits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why they chose the project as a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Baseball is a game of stats – and the Pioneer Press delivered plenty of them for Twins fans to consider and debate in its excellent data-driven package on hitting and the wind at Target Field. The Pioneer Press team chose an original topic, mined it from every angle and presented what they found in a well-written story, a set of impressive graphics and game-by-game data summaries. And they didn&#8217;t just present the data; they used it to offer informed advice and commentary on how the Twins should harness the wind to their advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other data journalism finalists were:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/daily_breeze-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="daily_breeze" /></p><p>Sam Gnerre, Miriam Velasquez and Chuck Bennett of the Los Angeles News Group win the DFMie for interactive journalism for their project on the <a title="L.A. riots interactive project" href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/riots">20th anniversary of the Rodney King riots</a>.</p>
<p>Their editors&#8217; nomination explains the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of our coverage for the 20th Anniversary of the LA Riots, we pored through our archives of our LA-area papers to re-create the news events as they happened at the time. We then digitized the archive photos and stories, and pulled them together into a comprehensive interactive timeline, which also included maps and TV media reports. This was our first use of the JS Timeline tool.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges told why they chose this as a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>The L.A. riots interactive timeline chronicles the series of events that led to one of the city&#8217;s most frightening social crises. Yet despite such a emotionally charged subject, the timeline&#8217;s clean presentation and intuitive navigation gently invites us into its abundant curation of archival content – including photos, videos, maps and quotes – and guides us back through a time we may not have otherwise wanted to revisit.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple weeks ago, members of Thunderdome's data team headed to the Global Editors Network Editors' Lab at the New York Times to wrestle with how to turn news storytelling into a game.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/newsgames-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Participants in the Editors&#039; Lab, including a team of data journalists from Thunderdome, posed for a picture at the end of the weekend. News organizations represented include the Associated Press, Boston Globe,  Chicago Tribune, NPR, ProPublica and more. (Jeanne Brooks/ONA)" /></p><p>Why just read the news when you can play it instead?</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, members of Thunderdome&#8217;s data team headed to the Global Editors Network <a title="Editors' Lab" href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/editors-lab/nyt/" target="_blank">Editors&#8217; Lab</a> at the New York Times to wrestle with how to turn news storytelling into a game. <a title="Editors' Lab at the New York Times" href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/editors-lab-at-the-new-york-times/" target="_blank">The event</a> brought teams from <a title="Editors' Lab teams" href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/editors-lab-newsgaming-ideas/" target="_blank">10 of the country&#8217;s top news organizations</a> together to compete to build the best online news games over the course of a weekend.</p>
<p>Thunderdome data developer <a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" title="Vaughn Hagerty" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/vhagerty/">Vaughn Hagerty</a> described the genesis of <a title="The pitch for The Waffler" href="http://bit.ly/waffler-pitch">our game</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I came up with the basic idea for The Waffler while listening to Columbia Journalism School professor <a title="Susan McGregor" href="https://twitter.com/susanemcg" target="_blank">Susan McGregor</a> <a title="Susan McGregor's master class at #EditorsLab" href="http://bit.ly/ZGpymk" target="_blank">speak about game design</a> and the types of &#8220;play&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">agon (competition)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">alea (chance)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">mimicry (simulation)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">ilinx (vertigo)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I wondered how we might incorporate a number of those aspects into a game that could be (mostly) built during the two days of the competition. The team had already discussed how at least some of the other teams&#8217; entries were likely to be quiz-type apps. We also talked about apps that might highlight some of the shenanigans endemic in politics.</p>
<p>I thought, what about political flip-flopping, where a candidate changes his or her position on a major issue, usually to gain popularity and, of course, votes? Could we build a game to simulate that process?</p>
<p>Thus, <a title="The Waffler" href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/the-waffler/" target="_blank">The Waffler</a> was born.</p></blockquote>
<div style="width: 728px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/the-waffler/"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DFMEL.jpg" width="718" height="477" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Waffler, the game built by members of Project Thunderdome&#8217;s data team at the Editors&#8217;s Lab hack weekend.</p></div>
<blockquote><p>The Waffler was built with HTML, CSS, a few images and a little over 200 lines of JavaScript. I used jQuery for some parts, along with a JavaScript templating library called <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>. A few data structures in the JavaScript keep track of the player&#8217;s choices and help determine when he or she &#8220;waffles.&#8221; I added a timer to help add excitement to the game and to make it more realistic. After all, politicians really don&#8217;t have the option of saying something like &#8220;let me think about it&#8221; when asked about their stances on issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Vaughn worked on the game mechanics, graphics editor <a title="Nelson Hsu" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu/">Nelson Hsu</a> designed the presentation. Data editor <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/">Tom Meagher</a> selected the questions that are thrown at players, researched the real polling data and crafted the final presentation for the jury. The Waffler was deliberately built to be used in any kind of election, from presidential to city council. Its use of poll data and hot-button issues ensure it could have universal appeal.</p>
<p>At the end of the weekend, we were thrilled to learn that <a title="The Waffler" href="http://app.wizehive.com/voting/view/elny2013/14408/1236428/0" target="_blank">our entry</a> was chosen as the first runner-up by the judges.</p>
<p>The winning entry came from the Chicago Tribune&#8217;s <a title="Trib Apps" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">news apps team</a>, which designed a <a title="GEN Editors' Lab news game hackathon" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/gen-newsgaming-hackathon/" target="_blank">Game Center</a> to showcase a series of mini and micro games that could be integrated into any story. There were plenty of other great games that emerged. In a blog post, the team from ProPublica offered a fantastic, <a title="ProPublica nerd blog" href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/heartsaver-an-experiment-in-using-news-games-to-tell-a-story" target="_blank">in-depth look</a> at <a title="HeartSaver" href="http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/heartsaver" target="_blank">HeartSaver</a>, their health care game that will send your pulse racing.</p>
<p>Have you played the games from the <a title="Editors' Lab" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/gen-newsgaming-hackathon/" target="_blank">Editors&#8217; Lab hack event</a> at the Times? Which was your favorite?</p>

<p>The feature, which started an occasional travel series in the Life section, included a <a title="Destinations: Mohonk Mountain House ..." href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2013/01/27/life/doc51032d1a40826941632310.txt?viewmode=fullstory">story and video</a> by <a title="Paula Freeman" href="https://twitter.com/anchoratfreeman">Paula Mitchell</a>, a <a title="Mohonk Mountain House slideshow" href="http://storify.com/ivanlajara/mohonk-moutain-house">Storify slideshow</a> of and <a title="Mohonk Mountain House" href="http://pinterest.com/dailyfreeman/mohonk-mountain-house/">Pinterest Pinboard</a> of photos by <a title="Tania Barricklo" href="https://twitter.com/tbarricklo">Tania Barricklo</a> and full-screen <a title="Mohonk Mountain House on New Hive" href="http://newhive.com/ivanlajara/mohonk-mountain-house?q=%40ivanlajara">New Hive interactive</a> including a Google map and a Google Earth flyover video. <a title="Ivan Lajara" href="https://twitter.com/ivanlajara">Ivan Lajara</a> produced the interactive features of the package.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">Judges liked the creative use of multimedia elements:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The Daily Freeman&#8217;s piece about Mohonk Mountain House was an interesting feature with awesome digital presentation. Between the video, photos and interactive slideshow, I feel like I&#8217;ve taken a tour of the castle without leaving my desk. I love the New Hive slideshow. I&#8217;ve signed up for an account of my own just because it looked so cool.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was personally most inspired by the castle project &#8212; the extent of information provided and the unique tools they used. It&#8217;s very extensive and interesting, yet totally doable and attainable for the regular journalist. This shows all of us what we could be doing with our stories. I feel like this is a great example of the future of journalism. I am signing up for a NewHive account right now, which means it sparked some action in me, even though I am across the country. I think this should be the winner because it has the potential to inspire other journalists, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote><p>The story was well-written and colorful. While it could have used quotes from guests , everything else was there. The lede was engaging. She chose a great place to write about and included ample support for why this place has been voted the best. I really enjoyed how she included colorful history of the castle. The video was well done. As one commenter said, &#8220;It was extremely enjoyable.&#8221; You really got a sense of place, though the audio for the marketing person was low and one interview was backlit. Her intro and narration was professional. I really liked how the story included the Hive interactive slideshow and the Storify component. It&#8217;s a great example of finding fresh ways to use new platforms.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/dp-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dp" /></p><p>The Denver Post&#8217;s <a href="http://yourhub.denverpost.com/denver" target="_blank">YourHub</a> community section has a great approach to grouping and displaying blotter items from its 10 zoned weekly editions.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/yhkevinh" target="_blank">Kevin Hamm</a>, a journalist for YourHub, wrote in an email to us that the blotter reports are &#8220;one of the more popular items we do, but they&#8217;re not easily read together since they&#8217;re in 10 different editions and 10 different websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I started gathering them all together, plotting them on a Google map, choosing the best dozen or so (out of 50 some-odd reports weekly), rewriting the headlines if necessary and putting them together in one post that runs on the Denver Post&#8217;s crime blog, the <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/crime/" target="_blank">Rap Sheet</a>,&#8221; Hamm wrote.</p>
<p>He adds that &#8220;it&#8217;s definitely a group effort&#8221; with the blotter for each edition written by the reporter specific to it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/TYSjo" target="_blank">interactive map</a> has been a hit, getting an average of two or three times the traffic as the full blog post.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a neat approach for both how it pulls together regional content and the added value of the map, which gives readers the ability to check out recent crimes based on their proximity to where they live or work. Plus, Kevin does a great job of pulling together the most interesting content and giving them punchy headlines.</p>
<p>Check out a recent example, &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/crime/2013/02/15/metro-denver-crime-blotter-man-waving-glow-sticks-caught-with-his-pants-down/4791/" target="_blank">Metro Denver Crime Blotter: Man waving glow sticks caught with his pants down</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>For DFM staffers looking to duplicate this effort, Kevin said he&#8217;d be happy to share more on his workflow and how to make it happen. Send him an <a href="mailto:HammK@YourHub.com"> email</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-07-at-12.34.29-PM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-07 at 12.34.29 PM" /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Journalists at <a href="http://dailycamera.com">The Daily Camera</a>, in Boulder, and the <a href="http://timescall.com">Longmont Times-Call</a> cover local holiday lights displays every holiday season, but this year decided to take their coverage to the next level. The two Colorado newsrooms worked together to produce an engaging package that satisfied a true need for their readers, while also trying out some new tools along the way. The eight-person group led by features editor Kevin Huhn collaborated with the central features team to produce an impressive digital package and a sharp print presentation.</p>
<p>The main attraction is a <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/art/ci_22186539">Google Map</a> that provides an easy-to-use guide to more than 100 local displays as well as the capability for readers to add their own. The team added free web tool <a href="http://www.thinglink.com/">Thinglink </a>to the mix this year, allowing them to <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/scene/333747544368611331">break out a single detailed photo</a> with annotations and other photos providing extra detail. A <a href="http://bcove.me/48ogmv84">66 second video</a> feature gave an in-depth look at one of the more spectacular homes in Longmont and journalists in both newsrooms put together <a href="http://www.timescall.com/news/longmont-local-news/ci_22185683">well-written</a> <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/art/ci_22186539">stories</a> for their digital and print editions.</p>
