<p><a title="Jessica Keating" href="https://twitter.com/keating_edits">Jessica Keating</a> and <a title="Gina Dvorak" href="http://about.me/designerGNA">Gina Dvorak</a> win the DFMie for best live coverage of 2012 for their <a title="Beyond the ballot box ..." href="http://storify.com/GNAdv/san-bernardino-county-ballot-path">coverage of vote counting on election night</a> for the San Bernardino Sun.</p>
<p>LANG Executive Editor Michael Anastasi explained in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voters know what it&#8217;s like to cast their ballots, but what happens after their ballot leaves its polling place? As part of our live online-only coverage, we followed the counting process live at the San Bernardino Registrar of Voters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why their coverage was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only was this an innovative use of Storify, it was multimedia-rich live coverage of a news event with behind-the-scenes photos, excellent context and it told a story. This was not your typical story about the voting process or going to the polls. It explored a new issue and gave readers a better understanding of the process. A hashtag was used to tie the conversation together. Very well done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for live coverage were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px">Paul Rogers of the Bay Area News Group for an <a title="Election liveblog" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_21938675">election liveblog</a>.</span></li>
<li>The York Daily Record for organizing and covering a <a title="York Daily Record candidates' night" href="http://www.ydr.com/ci_20189267/our-take-your-take-candidates-night-listen">candidates&#8217; night</a> where candidates listened to the public, instead of talking.</li>
</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[Multimedia coverage of the Mavericks Invitational big wave surfing event in Half Moon Bay won the Northern California DFMie for the staff of the Santa Cruz Sentinel.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/i-7GxrjRC-L-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="i-7GxrjRC-L" /></p><p>Multimedia coverage of the <a title="Mavericks International coverage" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/mavs">Mavericks Invitational big wave surfing event</a> in Half Moon Bay won the Northern California DFMie for the staff of the Santa Cruz Sentinel.</p>
<p>Editor Don Miller said the coverage generated more than 100,000 page views, during one of the world&#8217;s most famous big wave surfing events, which included seven surfers from Santa Cruz, called on 48 hours notice. Coverage included a gallery of <a title="Mavericks International photos through the years" href="http://photos.santacruzsentinel.com/2013/01/18/mavericks-invitational-photos/">historical Mavericks photos</a>, a <a title="Liveblog of Mavericks International" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/mavs/ci_22402254/mavericks-invitational-2013-live-updates">liveblog of photos and updates</a>, collaboration with <a title="Santa Cruz Waves" href="http://www.santacruzwaves.com/galleries/the-mavericks-invitational-2013/">Santa Cruz Waves</a>, as well as a Storify and sports staff <a title="Santa Cruz native ..." href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_22416630/sc-native-peter-mel-charges-win-at-mavericks">coverage of the competition</a>.</p>
<p>Judges praised the surfing package:</p>
<blockquote><p>With glorious photos, an online community conversation and well-reported stories, this coverage seems to hit the Digital First Media target dead-on. As a reader, I felt pulled into the event and was able to enjoy it immensely, even after the fact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>I particularly liked the social elements the staff put together, including a Twitter feed of the surfing participants. The coverage was nicely packaged as one-stop-shopping for surfing enthusiasts. I also enjoyed a photo gallery of past incarnations of the event. Dynamic images displayed well. If you were a community member interested in this surfing event, the Sentinel had it all for you.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Santa Cruz Sentinel covered the surfing competition thoroughly both visually and through social engagement &#8212; as this event clearly required. Surfing is a very visual sport, and the  Sentinel did a great job of incorporating visual elements into its coverage. I thought the slideshow from past events was a good idea and provided readers a look back. Socially, the curation of posts into a Storify added to the story by offering different perspectives. I also thought the stream of tweets from surfers on the site&#8217;s sidebar was a nice touch. Incorporating Instagram added to the visual storytelling as well as the social engagement. In addition to finding every possible angle to cover this story digitally, the Sentinel staff covered it with a traditional news story. All of these story methods worked well together, and the Sentinel dominated its coverage of the surfing contest.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Marin Independent Journal and Santa Cruz Sentinel newsrooms operate as part of the NorCal cluster, but both are part of the Bay Area News Group for business purposes.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A pipeline explosion is the kind of classic breaking-news story that journalists have been racing to cover for generations.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/Charleston-Daily-Mail-explosion-photos-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Charleston Daily Mail Facebook album of pipeline explosion photos" /></p><p>A pipeline explosion is the kind of classic breaking news story that journalists have raced to cover for generations. But a pipeline explosion today does more than just send a fireball into the sky &#8212; it shuts down an Interstate highway and sparks a social media explosion of cell-phone photos and eyewitness accounts.</p>
<p>The Charleston Daily Mail excelled in old-school reporting and photojournalism as well as curating the social media stream in coverage of the Dec. 11 explosion of a Columbia Gas line near Sissonville, W.Va. The staff coverage of the blast won the DFMie for December for the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster of Digital First Media.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>On the scanner, police are reporting a &#8220;major gas line fire&#8221; near Sissonville.</p>
<p>&mdash; Zack Harold (@ZackHarold) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackHarold/status/278558630469586945">December 11, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Northbound traffic now shut down at the I77/79 split in Charleston &#8211; northbound traffic being diverted to I79. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23KanCoBlast">#KanCoBlast</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jared Hunt (@jaredwv) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredwv/status/278570277619781632">December 11, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Editor Nanya Friend explained in her nomination how the Daily Mail staff covered the blast:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Dec. 11, the Charleston Daily Mail staff learned that a gas pipeline had exploded in a residential area. Turned out it was a monster fireball that rumbled toward Interstate 77, scorching homes, burning trees, melting cars and making the highway asphalt crumble. We sent three reporters and a photographer to the scene, while three reporters stayed in the office, making calls and helping monitor social media posts.</p>
<p>We created the hashtag <a title="#KanCoBlast" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23kancoblast&amp;src=typd">#KanCoBlast</a>, and encouraged other news organizations to use it. Our live reporters used the hashtag in their tweets from the scene. We used the newspaper Twitter account to retweet the reporters and to share photos, video and graphics as they became available.</p>
<p>We created three different Storify streams during the first hours of coverage. As the news developed, we updated an <a title="Storify of Sissonville gas explosion" href="http://storify.com/zackharold/possible-explosion-in-sissonville">initial Storify</a> that served as a reservoir of breaking news and reaction. That Storify received more than 4,000 views. Later, we created a <a title="Photos of pipeline explosion" href="http://storify.com/bradmcelhinny/photos-of-the-kancoblast">Storify of just photos</a>, and then a Storify the next day detailing the <a title="I-77 reopens with amazing speed" href="http://storify.com/bradmcelhinny/i-77-re-opens-with-amazing-speed-here-s-how-it-hap">overnight repaving efforts on the interstate</a>. Those other stories received a combined 1,000+ views.</p>
<p>On Facebook, we created a <a title="Charleston Daily Mail photo gallery" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151157863481272.447482.17795641271&amp;type=1&amp;l=8fb9c0e6bf">photo gallery</a> of submitted and staff photos, which we continued to update. The photo album itself was shared 200 times, and several of the individual photos received dozens of shares.   We also posted to Facebook and Twitter two graphics we created &#8212; a <a title="Pipeline explosion locator map" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151157890786272&amp;set=pb.17795641271.-2207520000.1355347700&amp;type=3&amp;theater">locator map</a> showing where the blast occurred, and a <a title="Pipeline explosion detour map" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151158039261272&amp;set=pb.17795641271.-2207520000.1355347682&amp;type=3&amp;theater">detour map</a> telling travelers the best route while the interstate was closed. These graphics received several shares and retweets on both social networks.</p>
<p>On our website, we posted an <a title="Gas line explosion creates Interstate inferno" href="http://www.dailymail.com/policebrfs/201212110063">initial breaking news story</a>, which received more than 600 Facebook recommendations. We kept this story updated with confirmed reports, photos, video, and a link to the Storify. We also shared this story on Facebook, where it received almost 50 shares, and Twitter, where it was retweeted dozens of times. We added a video to our story, and the video received more than 1,400 views.</p>
<p>The next day, coverage dominated the front page of our print edition. We posted the photo to Facebook, where it received more than 50 shares.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Daily Mail hit several factors on this story: great breaking news coverage; using multiple digital tools such as social media and video; and community engagement by integrating reader comments, photos and videos into their coverage.</p>
<p>I was impressed by the way the staff scrambled to update the breaking story, to create a Storify to pull in reader comments and multimedia, to put updates on Twitter and their blog, and to really involve readers in telling the story. They have also continued to follow up on the story, covering the impact on the victims as well as the investigation into the explosion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Breaking news is always exciting for reporters and editors but the new digital tools available for doing compelling storytelling give us lots of great options to catch readers and the Daily Mail did this well. The stories were complete (and I notice they have done lots of good follow-up coverage) but the visuals – posted via Twitter, Facebook and Storify – really made me take notice.</p>
<p>The immediacy of the disaster was captured by the photo postings and this was a tremendous visual story with the monster fireball consuming the neighborhood. Creating a hashtag early was a great move so that readers could follow the news as it developed on the scene from multiple sources. Getting so many hits on the Storify presentations must have been rewarding for the newsroom crew.</p>
<p>The locator map and detour map were also useful additions for readers. Experimenting with Facebook, Twitter and other social media is a learning experience for all newsrooms as we figure out how to expand our audience and how to crowdsource on breaking stories; it sounds like these tools worked well for this story so kudos to the reporters, photographers and editors who pulled it all together.</p></blockquote>
<p>The stellar coverage of the Daily Mail staff continued after the blast:</p>
