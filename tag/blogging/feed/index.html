				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/Mile-High-Mamas-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Mile High Mamas" /></p><p><a title="Mile High Mamas" href="http://www.milehighmamas.com">Mile High Mamas</a> wins the DFMie for Community Blog, the only DFMie not awarded to a Digital First Media staff member.</p>
<p>DFM encourages newsrooms to network with community blogs, showcasing their local content on news sites and driving traffic to other outlets with news and information about community life. This award recognizes the success of the Denver blog founded by Amber Johnson.</p>
<p>Denver Post editors explained the success of the blog in their nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mile High Mamas was created as an entertaining community resource for area moms. The site includes regular posts by some of Colorado&#8217;s most popular Mommy Bloggers, a message board, monthly cutest kid contest, and a Mama Drama advice column. They also hold regular giveaways and product reviews.</p>
<p>The site was the brainchild of Amber Johnson, and she is the glue that keeps the whole thing running. She is constantly updating the blog postings so that different voices are represented on the pages, and gives readers many reasons to keep coming back. And the metrics year over year speak for themselves: 2012 pageviews: 689,078; 2011 pageviews: 456,369.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained their choice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our pick for community blogger is Mile High Mamas, a wonderful blog with a compelling, entertaining mix of personal pieces, intriguing questions, spotlights on events and tips and far more. Parenting blogs are a digital staple, but many aren&#8217;t worth the time their authors or readers put into them. But Mile High Mamas, which offers posts that are consistently useful, not to mention a robust forum and a cute kids photo contest/gallery that&#8217;s hard not to click through at least occasionally. This is a blog that&#8217;s grown into a community that readers have made their own, and that any town would envy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for best community blogger were <a title="Norm Pattis Blog" href="http://www.pattisblog.com/index.php?article=Who_Owns_New_Haven_s_Green__5317&amp;limit=10&amp;page=topic&amp;q=Who+Owns+New+Haven%5C%27s+Green%3F">Norm Pattis</a> of the <a title="New Haven Register Community Media Lab" href="http://www.nhregister.com/blogs/medialab/">New Haven Register&#8217;s Community Media Lab</a> and Blake Stough, whose <a title="Preserving York" href="http://www.preservingyork.com/">Preserving York</a> is part of the York Daily Record&#8217;s <a title="York Blog" href="http://www.yorkblog.com/">York Blog</a> network.</p>
<p>Johnson launched Mile High Mamas in September 2007 with a team of dedicated Denver-area bloggers. It has grown from a simple blog to an online and offline community with regular events, a weekly newsletter, deals, contests and so much more.</p>

<p>Johnson is originally from Canada but spent a number of years working as a publicist for Utah’s ski and outdoor industry while moonlighting as a radio personality and travel writer. She started blogging in 2003 and has received various accolades including being selected as Microsoft&#8217;s accredited blogger at the 2010 Vancouver Games. In addition to running Mile High Mamas, Amber writes a regular column in The Denver Post&#8217;s $MART section, freelances as a family travel writer and also as a social media strategist. On a personal level, Amber is passionate about exploring the outdoors with her two children and is happily married to man obsessed with growing the Great Pumpkin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Robert-Mills-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Robert Mills" /></p><p><a title="Robert Mills" href="https://twitter.com/Robert_Mills">Robert Mills</a> of the Lowell Sun wins the DFMie as the best staff blogger of Digital First Media.</p>
<p>His editor&#8217;s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rob Mills, The Sun&#8217;s night police reporter, gets it. His <a title="Police Line" href="http://blogs.lowellsun.com/policeline/">Police Line</a> blog is not a dumping ground for breaking news. Mills adds photos, edits and embeds his own video, and provides added detail and context to his work. He also engages his followers in the behind-the-scenes ethical questions that he encounters. Our readers have responded; his blog is the most read on <a href="http://lowellsun.com">lowellsun.com</a> by a factor of four or five. He is a worthy candidate for this award.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DFMie judges agreed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our pick is Police Line, from the Lowell Sun. It&#8217;s good, passionate and tireless work from the perspective of a veteran reporter who conveys his journalistic and human values, as well as his love for the community he covers. The blog is rich with an unusual level of detail and photos that put the reader right at the scene. One notable recent post even included a well-written account of an accident sent in by a 13-year-old resident who responded to the scene along with police, fire and ambulance. Talk about user-generated content. We also appreciated the spurs for community action at the end of each post. Police Line is worth a regular visit even if you don&#8217;t live in the Lowell, Mass., area.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for staff blogger were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="Evan Brandt" href="https://twitter.com/pottstownnews">Evan Brandt</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., for his <a title="Evan Brandt's Digital Notebook" href="http://evan-brandt.blogspot.com/2012/05/welfare-for-white-and-wealthy.html">Digital Notebook</a>, where he posted daily, 365 posts in 2012. Brandt was also a finalist for Mid-Sized Daily Journalist of the Year.</span></li>
<li><a title="Fred J. Robledo" href="https://twitter.com/SGVNSports">Fred Robledo</a>, Local Sports Editor for the Los Angeles News Group for his <a title="Fred J. Robledo on Prep Sports" href="http://www.insidesocal.com/tribpreps/2012/08/24/friday-night-co-1/">San Gabriel Valley Tribune  prep sports blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mills has been at The Sun since Sept. 9, 2002. He has worked for MediaNews Group since Jan. 24, 2000, first at the Lebanon Daily News, and then at the Fitchburg Sentinel. He attended Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa., as a journalism major, but left a semester early to go to work in Lebanon.</p>
<p>He has a 10-month-old daughter Charlotte Mills and lives in Lowell with his girlfriend Giovanna Aviles. &#8220;I&#8217;m a stay-at-home dad by day, and then a crime reporter at night. I love the night shift (4 to midnight) because it means I&#8217;m home with my daughter each day.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">&#8220;Sad as it usually is, I love reporting on crime and spot news,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;I think we need to confront our readers with the sad reality that occurs most days in our cities, and I think graphic reporting on the violence and tragedy that is part of this beat is the best way to help our society understand and deal with the issues. &#8230; </span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">I think I&#8217;m privileged to tell the stories of people and incidents that many people would like to ignore.&#8221;</span></p>
