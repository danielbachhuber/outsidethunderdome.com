Willis</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> of the Bay Area News Group won the </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/03/25/2014-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank">2014 Data Journalism DFMie</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> for their analysis of pay for public workers.</span></p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each year, Thomas Peele and Daniel Willis painstakingly collect compensation data from hundreds of public agencies across Northern California to expose little-known perks for government employees that leave taxpayers fuming and seasoned watchdogs scratching their heads.</p>
<p>Their enterprising approach to government reporting starts with the mammoth task of badgering more than 600 agencies for data and managing hundreds of public records requests, then building a database for all to search at <a href="http://mercurynews.com/salaries" target="_blank">www.mercurynews.com/salaries</a>. With fewer reporters covering city halls, Peele and Willis mine data to reveal the scope of ongoing government waste — a true public service.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reporters Thomas Peele and Daniel Willis of the Bay Area News Group win the DFMie for best data journalism for surfacing Northern California’s excessive perks and salary for government employees. Thomas and Daniel collected and analyzed government employee compensation from more than 600 agencies. The data yielded stories about the BART’s top-paid worker of 2012 never worked a day and part-time job at the harbor commission that paid $1,100 an hour. They also created an easy-to-use database widget to search the compensation records. Without the data work, none of these stories would of been possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stories submitted for judging included one documenting that <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23416601/barts-top-paid-worker-2012-never-worked-day">Bay Area Rapid Transit’s top-paid worker of 2012 never worked a day</a>, one about <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/salary-survey/ci_24344700/1-100-an-hour-part-time-service-at">part-time workers getting up to $1,100 an hour</a> and one on <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/salary-survey/ci_24798591/former-part-time-pols-bay-area-reap-medical">former part-time politicians getting taxpayer-funded medical benefits</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of four DFMies for the Bay Area News Group.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the third in a series of reports from three Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR14 through the Digital First Represents program.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the third in a series of reports from three Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR14 through the <a title="And the #NICAR14 Digital First Represents winners are …" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/20/nicar14-digital-represents-winners-are/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents program</a>.</em></p>
<p>Late last year, a worker at York Hospital (in Pennsylvania) erroneously injected a patient with radioactive white blood cells, a pharmaceutical designed to detect infections.</p>
<p>Aside from some minor swelling, the patient showed no ill effects. The patient received the same level of radiation a person receives in a year from the natural environment.</p>
<p>Much of my <a href="http://www.ydr.com/business/ci_24891937/" target="_blank">reporting</a> for that story came from data that I pulled from U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>At the time, I was not aware of the Association of Health Care Journalists&#8217; <a href="http://www.hospitalinspections.org/" target="_blank">website</a> — a repository of hospital reviews sorted by area.</p>
<h1>Data improves health coverage</h1>
<p>During his turn at the NICAR 2014 microphone, <a href="https://twitter.com/byPeterEisler" target="_blank">Peter Eisler</a> of USA Today took those who attended the &#8220;Wading through the sea of data of hospitals, doctors, medicine and more&#8221; session on a tour of this website and that of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>Using tips passed along by Eisler, I learned that officials had uncovered a medical screening exam violation at a local hospital — data that could lead to a follow-up to my original story.</p>
<p>Both Eisler and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/dan-keating/2012/09/27/8207c022-08ca-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_page.html" target="_blank">Dan Keating</a> of The Washington Post explained ways to download the <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare" target="_blank">physician compare database.</a></p>
<p>For example, with the help of ArcView and U.S. Census data shape files, I can map doctors by their age, specialty and school in which they graduated. Taking income data, I can layer the map to show where younger/older doctors practice. Such a map could also do the same for specialities.</p>
<p>Do plastic surgeons practice in more affluent areas of the York County area? What sections of York County are home to the fewest doctors?</p>
<h1>Data improves public housing coverage</h1>
<p>Mapping, as I learned in mini boot camp at NICAR, can and should be applied to multiple topics.</p>
<p>Tim Henderson pointed out in his <a href="http://slid.es/timhenderson/section8">session</a> — &#8221;How to uncover inequity and swindlers in subsidized housing programs near you&#8221; — that maps would be the ideal way to show the disbursement of the public housing across an area.</p>
<p>After haggling with HUD for Section 8 housing data, Henderson said he was able not only to produce a map of public housing, but he also painted a clear picture of an economically distressed area.</p>
<p>He was able to use census data to gauge minority population and rental percentages to peer into the the availability of the affordable housing in a given area.</p>
<p>What Henderson found was that areas with little or no Section 8 housing and few rentals may discourage affordable housing. Also, he recommended looking at minority census tracts and mapping the affordable housing options.</p>
<h1>Data improves education coverage</h1>
<p>Full disclosure: I&#8217;m not an education writer. Sure, I&#8217;ve covered school-related stories as they&#8217;ve crossed into my beat, but my focus has never been standardized tests or the mapping of school bus routes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s going to change.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/coulterjones" target="_blank">Coulter Jones</a> of WNYC New York Public Radio pointed out some great ideas for education-related stories that I plan to report.</p>
<p>For example, during his session, Jones suggested that journalists request attendance records. This data may be used to check fire alarm/student ratios and which schools have the worst problems with attendance.</p>
<p>He urged us to request the records of school bus drivers, such as accident reports and criminal histories.</p>
<p>Another good suggestion was to overlay health inspection data with school attendance to see if students are getting sick after a failed inspection.</p>
<p><em>Why stop there? That&#8217;s just a look at how data can improve Sean&#8217;s beat coverage. Check out Chrys Wu&#8217;s compendium of <a href="http://blog.chryswu.com/2014/02/21/nicar14-slides-tutorials-links-tools/" target="_blank">slides and handouts from NICAR</a> to see how data can help upgrade your beat.  </em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[At NICAR, Lindsey Anderson learned that data is much more than official statistics. Here are some tips and examples to help you DIY (Do It Yourself).]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/180407759-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="(Photo by ThinkStock)" /></p><p>Before I went to the annual <a title="DFM at #NICAR14" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/live/dfm-nicar14/">NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting)</a> conference, I often thought of data as numbers gathered and distributed by officials or academics — like annual crime statistics or Census databases. If no such data existed, then I thought journalists were out of luck.</p>
<p>But NICAR taught me that data can be so much more than official statistics.</p>
<p>So here’s how to channel your inner Nellie Bly and DIY (Do It Yourself) data.</p>
<p><b>Look at the notes in your notebook. </b>That’s data. When we take notes on something, say, a privately funded educational program, we record the 5 W’s. That’s data.</p>
<p>For inspiration, check out: <a href="http://homicidewatch.org/" target="_blank">Homicide Watch D.C.</a> This site gathers data from police reports, court documents and court hearings to examine every homicide in Washington, D.C. The thorough reporting allows the creators, Laura and Chris Amico, to analyze trends by race, location and more.</p>
<p><b>Documents are full of data</b>, we just don’t see it as such. When going through piles and piles of documents, record what you find in a database and turn it into data you can analyze.</p>
<p>Check out USA Today’s <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/mass-killings/index.html" target="_blank">“Behind the Bloodshed”</a> on mass killings in the United States. The FBI records murders in which four or more people died, but USA Today found dozens of such killings (the tan circles on the chart) of which the FBI had no record. The team turned to news reports, set Google Alerts and pored over thousands of police reports from killings across the country to find a truer picture of mass killings in the U.S.</p>
<p><b>And then there’s the Internet.</b> If you can’t find data on your subject, turn to Internet chat sites, social media and more. Turn your findings into data.</p>
<p>Check out Reuters’ <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1" target="_blank">“The Child Exchange.”</a> A Reuter’s reporter was researching adoptions online and came across a Yahoo group in which parents sought new homes for children they adopted from abroad and other people were looking for such kids to bring home. The practice is entirely unregulated, so a parent can sign away a child to a stranger and that’s that. Reporter Meghan Twohey took screenshots of every post about a child and recorded all data to track their ages, genders, whether they had behavioral problems and more.</p>
<p><b>Don’t forget science.</b> <b> </b>Curious about the water quality in your town? Take your own samples and send them into a lab. If you don’t trust the official report or no one is keeping track of an issue, use science to keep track of it yourself.</p>
<h1>So how do you do a DIY data project?</h1>
<p><b>1. Plan. Plan. Plan. </b>What do you want to know? What questions will you ask the data and people? Determine your methodology.</p>
<p><b>2. Dive in. </b>You have to start sometime.</p>
<p><b>3. Keep it manageable and quantifiable. </b>You can’t look at everything.</p>
<p><b>4. Bounce ideas off a partner or editor.</b></p>
<p><b>5. Don’t recreate the wheel. </b>Verify results and findings with academics and experts.</p>
<p><strong>6. Talk to people.</strong> Data can only go so far. It&#8217;s the people that make a story.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In the first of a series from Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR 14, Jason Hoppin explains the gift, and curse, of awareness in data journalism.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This is the first in a series of reports from three Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR14 through the <a title="And the #NICAR14 Digital First Represents winners are …" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/20/nicar14-digital-represents-winners-are/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents program</a>.</em></p>
<p>There were close to 1,000 journalists at the <a href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/" target="_blank">2014 NICAR convention</a>, a nearly 50 percent increase over the prior year. That there were so many should tell you a few things: the idea of bending technology to serve journalism (especially investigatory journalism) is reaching a critical mass; the technology itself is accelerating; and people are starting to see how incredibly valuable this toolbox is to finding and telling stories.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. You’ve heard of the wildly popular (it raised $500,000 via Kickstarter) <a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title" target="_blank">NPR t-shirt project</a>? People who were at the conference helped create it.</p>
<p>You know the crazy story of how the Florida SunSentinel used toll booth information to calculate how fast off-duty cops were driving? Data guys were behind it, and won <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Public-Service" target="_blank">a Pulitzer Prize</a> for public service.</p>
<p>How about the LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-0301-lafd-hiring-20140301,0,5887646.story#axzz2uviWfQLN" target="_blank">recently plowing through hiring practices</a> at the LA Fire Department, leading to allegations of nepotism and quick vows of reform? A data guy is on the byline.</p>
<p>But what I most want to tell people about is a phenomenon that occurs to people at NICAR with any level of experience. This happened to me several times:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bQxpk69At2g/Uo7YI1wiJ-I/AAAAAAAABzc/CC9xxeuXR6Y/s1600/72917-hold-it-hold-it-what-the-hell-gfHV.gif" /></p>
<p>Once, someone showed me how to yank a table out of a PDF using <a title="Tabula" href="http://tabula.nerdpower.org/" target="_blank">Tabula</a>, software he helped write. This is normally like pulling a sword from a stone. Now all you have to do is click, drag and push enter.</p>
<p>Another time, a speaker who was showing us how to manipulate spreadsheets with <a title="OpenRefine" href="http://openrefine.org/" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> vowed: “What I’m going to show you is pure magic. It’s a miracle of modern technology.” We were skeptical. The work he was talking about can take hours. And then he compressed everything into a single click of a button, and the room nearly broke out in a riot. (This same phenomenon happened to someone I know — he had spent four hours that week working on something that our own <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/mwebster" target="_blank">Mary Jo Webster</a> showed him how to do in five minutes).</p>
<p>One speaker told us to buy a $20 European USB radio tuner on Amazon, and within a few keystrokes you could have a map of every airplane flying overhead at that moment show up on your browser. You could also do this for every large boat off shore. And tune into pretty much any public safety radio frequency.</p>
<p>I learned how to script a web app and publish to the Internet without using a backend database <i>or even a web server </i>from the guy who put all of Nate Silver’s stuff up on the New York Times website.</p>
<p>I learned how to use <a href="http://ban.jo" target="_blank">Ban.jo</a>, <a href="http://foursquare.com" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://geofeedia.com" target="_blank">Geofeedia</a> to find sources at breaking news scenes, with the latter searching multiple social media platforms within a defined radius, at a certain time. Think about that.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of creating your own data, and how to utilize government inspection reports or fracking data or the Census. We heard a million great ideas. And we heard the limitations on those great ideas, because it all still comes down to reporting and verifying the truth.</p>
<p>Someone else taught us how to use cheap audio sensors to collect noise data and do stories, and how to hack digital cameras to take infrared pictures to track environmental changes. That speaker also talked about drones, and how <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/" target="_blank">Google has developed a smartphone</a> that could potentially use the power of the crowd to digitize and map the interior spaces of, well … everything, everywhere.</p>
<p>I won’t veer off here into evangelism about how valuable this stuff is in an increasingly abstracted world, chopped into bits and bytes, quantified, and stored on a server somewhere in the middle of Kansas. Though the thought did cross my mind.</p>
<p>But I was inspired. And I felt more cunning in a way, as if I learned to think differently about this job. It’s not like I didn’t know this was possible — well, hacking digital cameras was definitely new — but it feels more attainable, very much within reach.</p>
<p>That is the curse. I have been stripped of my excuses. There were people at the conference who barely spoke English and were still trying to sit around the fire in search in insight. What reasons do I have left? My chore now is to go commit some journalism. It is a nice burden to have, especially when you feel armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>That LA Times database nerd who’s nailing the LAFD to the wall? His name is Ben Welsh. He spoke at the conference, and someone was geeky enough to upload a cell phone video of his talk to YouTube, as if Ben were Bruce Springsteen covering a Lorde song.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t me. But you should watch it. Seriously.</p>

<p>Award-winning journalist MaryJo Webster <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/28/maryjo-webster-thunderdome-data-team/" target="_blank">recently joined</a> Thunderdome’s data team as our new senior data reporter, bringing with her years of experience in analytical and investigative reporting. She joins us from the <a href="http://pioneerpress.com/" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>, where she was the computer-assisted reporting editor since 2005.</p>
<p>In addition to being an expert on Minnesota’s public records law, MaryJo also teaches a data journalism class at the University of Minnesota. Her work has been both excellent and prolific, winning her two DFMies in 2012 for <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/pioneer-press/pioneer-press-homerun-project-wins-data-journalism-dfmie/" target="_blank">data journalism</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/pioneer-press-examination-public-pension-spiking-wins-investigative-journalism-dfmie/" target="_blank">investigative reporting</a>.</p>
<p>What new and exciting things can you expect to see from the Thunderdome data team with the addition of MaryJo? We asked her to share some of her background as well as prospective projects, plus tips on reporting and her favorite thing to do in the Twin Cities.</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Lives in</strong>: Arden Hills, Minn. (a suburb of St. Paul)<br />
<strong>Hometown</strong>: Kasson, Minn.<br />
<strong>Graduated from: </strong>University of Missouri-Columbia, University of Wisconsin-River Falls<br />
<strong>Degree(s)</strong>: Masters and Bachelors in journalism<br />
<strong>Previous employers</strong>: St. Paul Pioneer Press, USA Today, Center for Public Integrity, Investigative Reporters and Editors, Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern, New Ulm (Minn.) Journal</p>
<h2><strong>On the job</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What will you be doing in your new role?</strong><br />
I will be spearheading national, data-driven stories — doing reporting, data analysis, writing and/or project management, as needed. These could be stories developed by local reporters at one or more of the DFM newsrooms, or it might be something developed from Thunderdome, or it might be projects that other organizations (such as ProPublica or the Center for Investigative Reporting) are sharing with DFM. In addition, I&#8217;ll be conducting virtual or in-person training sessions on a variety of data journalism topics, for DFM reporters and editors.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of projects do you plan to tackle?</strong><br />
Anything! I especially love education and environment issues, but the stories that could be done in this job are truly endless.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is “computer-assisted reporting”? Isn’t most reporting computer-assisted these days?</strong><br />
Yes, the term &#8220;computer-assisted reporting&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to fit anymore, and increasingly it&#8217;s being called &#8220;data journalism.&#8221; Computer-assisted reporting (CAR) got its name in the early 1990s when desktop computers were still quite new to journalism and the Internet didn&#8217;t exist. Interestingly, even back then there were people who didn&#8217;t think this was the right name. The debate crops up among data journalists pretty much every year! Whatever you call it, the definition is the same. It&#8217;s a set of skills that enable journalists to do their own analysis of data, rather than solely relying on public officials or non-profit organizations. In the past decade, that skillset has broadened to include making data accessible online for readers to explore, either through interactive maps, graphics or searchable databases.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into investigative journalism?<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve had a passion for watchdog-type stories ever since I learned about the Washington Post&#8217;s reporting on Watergate, when I was a teenager. So, early in my career I looked for ways to get into a job that would allow me to do that full-time. After five years as a beat reporter at small daily newspapers, I found that data journalism skills would be the best way to get there.</p>
<p><strong>What are some stories you’ve done that you are proudest of?<br />
</strong>There are lots. But here are three:</p>
<p>When I was at USA Today, I wanted to measure whether it was true that high schools in more affluent neighborhoods/communities earned more state championship trophies than schools in less affluent areas. We spent months collecting lists of state championship winners from 13 states that we picked as a representative sample of the U.S. Then we matched that to various measures of income for the schools and the neighborhoods they were located in. The resulting analysis showed that the more affluent schools won state championships at twice the rate of those in the least affluent areas. <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2004-06-17-titles-1a-cover_x.htm">The story is still online,</a> if you&#8217;d like to read it.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Also while at the Pioneer Press, one of the suburbs of St. Paul started talking about imposing restrictions on where certain sex offenders could live in the city. The restrictions would require them to stay a certain distance away from things like schools, daycare facilities, parks, places of worship and bus stops. I plotted those places (except the bus stops) onto a map using ArcGIS mapping software, then added the restriction zones. The resulting map showed the proposed ordinance would effectively force these sex offenders out of the city. The only places not covered by a restricted zone were under a major freeway or in an industrial park. A few days after our story (and the map) published, the city council tabled the measure and has not brought it up again. Unfortunately, this story isn&#8217;t online anymore.</span></p>
<p>During my last year at the Pioneer Press, I spent a lot of time covering public pension issues in Minnesota. Getting up to speed on how pensions work was incredibly difficult. I think it easily took six months of reading and re-reading material and asking lots of questions before I understood it well enough to write <a href="http://www.twincities.com/pensions/ci_22405432/minnesota-theres-what-pensions-promise-then-theres-what" target="_blank">this story about the financial footing of Minnesota&#8217;s public pensions</a>, plus several other related stories. It was especially rewarding to get compliments from both pension experts and general readers about how well I had done explaining such a difficult topic.</p>
<p><strong>What role does data reporting play in journalism now, and how do you see it changing? Is it more or less prominent than before?</strong><br />
Data journalism is increasingly becoming a core necessity in newsrooms. Nearly all of the information reporters seek from government offices is stored in a database or spreadsheet. And news organizations are seeking more opportunities to share data with readers, either through interactive maps/graphics or searchable databases. Both of these aspects require staff members to have at least basic data skills.</p>
<p><strong>What skills do you teach students in your “Database Reporting” course?</strong><br />
I teach a combination of the thought process that goes into analyzing data, along with specific skills in various types of software. We analyze data in a spreadsheet program and a database manager, use various tools for cleaning inconsistent data and then also learn some basic tools for creating online graphics and maps. The underlying message that flows throughout the entire course is the idea that data is a source. Much like your human sources, it can tell you the wrong answer if you don&#8217;t ask the right question. And it can give you some answers, but also often leads you to more questions.</p>
<p><strong>What are some important do’s and don’ts for aspiring data reporters?</strong><br />
The most important thing to do is to practice, practice, practice. Learning how to do data analysis is like learning a foreign language. It takes some work to reach fluency.</p>
<p>On the flip side, don&#8217;t set out trying to do a really big, complex analysis/investigation on your first go-around. Find a small, relatively benign story to tackle first. Then work your way up.</p>
<p><strong>What’s some background that others probably don’t know about you?</strong><br />
I had almost zero knowledge of sports statistics when I took the job at the USA Today sports department. At one point when we were getting an insanely huge database from the PGA, I had to go to the golf editor and ask him to explain the game so I could understand the data. He very nicely pulled out a piece of paper, started drawing and said, &#8220;This is the fairway. This is the green &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How will you be splitting your time between Minnesota and New York?</strong><br />
Mostly I&#8217;ll be camped out at my home office, but will try to make at least a couple visits a year to the New York office. With this being a new position that no one has ever tackled before, it&#8217;s hard to say how we will operate.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a great data resource you think more journalists should know about/utilize?</strong><br />
The <a href="http://ire.org/nicar/">database library</a> at the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (an affiliate of Investigative Reporters and Editors). They obtain, clean up and then make available (at a small fee) to reporters dozens of national datasets. Many of them are either difficult or time-consuming to obtain, or require a bit too much cleanup for the average reporter to do themselves. The staff will also do analysis for a news organization (for a fee) .</p>
<h2>Real talk</h2>
<p><strong>Why journalism?</strong><br />
I want to hold public officials accountable for how they spend our money.</p>
<p><strong>Do you subscribe to any print publications?</strong><br />
The St. Paul Pioneer Press, The New Yorker, Women&#8217;s Health and Parents. Although I must confess that I&#8217;m starting to read the New Yorker on my iPad. It&#8217;s handy having them all in one place, especially since they pile up on me and I usually have 2 or 3 months&#8217; worth at a time to read.</p>
<p><strong>What would happen if you were disconnected from the Internet and your phone for 48 hours?</strong><br />
I would probably have some withdrawal-type symptoms, worried that I&#8217;m missing some important email. But as long as my kids were with me (so I could physically make sure they&#8217;re okay), I think I would get by. My husband, on the other hand, would be freaking out and trying to figure out how he could fix it.</p>
<p><strong>If you could have unfettered access to the documents of any company or organization in the world, which would you choose?</strong><br />
Good question. I think I would choose the Pentagon. I think there are far too many secrets — or at least things that are not routinely published — about how the military operates and, more importantly, spends our money.</p>
<p><strong>What was the first thing you read this morning?</strong><br />
My email. Beyond that, I can&#8217;t remember.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your all-time favorite sports team?</strong><br />
Minnesota Vikings. I spent so many Sundays as a child, sitting with my father, watching the Purple People Eaters and asking him a million questions about the game. I still remember being so excited to go to summer training camp, where I got Tommy Kramer&#8217;s autograph.</p>
<p><strong>If you could interview any historical figure, who would it be?</strong><br />
Probably one of the legislators who helped craft the Bill of Rights. I&#8217;d love to try to answer that question that the Supreme Court always wrestles with: &#8220;What exactly did they mean by this?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What’s for lunch today?</strong><br />
Homemade chili.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your go-to karaoke song?</strong><br />
I haven&#8217;t done karaoke in at least 20 years!</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve lived in a number of Midwestern cities — which one wins your heart?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t know that I can come up with a particular city. But I can safely say that the Twin Cities is truly an awesome place. Yes, everybody knows us for the bitter cold and tons of snow (especially this year). But there&#8217;s something about the people here — it&#8217;s more than just the &#8220;Minnesota Nice&#8221; that we&#8217;re known for. People tend to be hardworking, willing to help anyone at the drop of a hat, and committed to taking care of the world around us.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite thing to do in the Twin Cities?</strong><br />
Go to my family cabin. And BTW, you aren&#8217;t considered a true Minnesotan until your family has a cabin &#8220;up north.&#8221; Mine has been in my family since 1937 — even before my mother was born. And I love watching my children learn to love it as much as I do.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">What book has had the greatest impact on you?<br />
</strong>The &#8220;Poisonwood Bible&#8221; by Barbara Kingsolver. Fabulous book.</p>
<p><strong>Name someone we should all follow on Twitter right now.</strong><br />
Instead of a person, I&#8217;m going to recommend you track the hashtag, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nicar14" target="_blank">#NICAR14</a>, for the next few days (through March 2). There will be a deluge of tweets from the <a href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/">National CAR Conference</a> that is being held in Baltimore.

		<description><![CDATA[The very thought of crunching numbers and analyzing rows of data is enough to send many journalists running for the hills. My advice? Don’t. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/BIGDATA-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="BIGDATA" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the eighth in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Data, data, data.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Do you tremble with fear at the sight of that word?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The very thought of crunching numbers and analyzing rows of data is enough to send many journalists running for the hills. My advice? Don’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Yes, data can be overwhelming. Numbers can be scary. But it’s time we show the numbers who’s boss. Thanks to the advancements of the digital age, data tools and numbers have become so much easier to manage. If we face our data fears, we can tell some really compelling stories.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">I attended the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UoG_UpQ4W4E" target="_blank">Big Data, Little Newsroom</a> session at ONA13 for a couple reasons. I too begin sweating bullets when someone says it’s time to open up a spreadsheet and look at some numbers. As a journalist, I thought this was  a good opportunity to challenge myself and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This low-key session was led by <a href="https://twitter.com/CarewGrovum">Emma Carew Grovum</a>, special projects researcher at <a href="http://philanthropy.com/section/Home/172/">The Chronicle of Philanthropy</a>, and was directed at smaller newsrooms with bigger aspirations. I found the session was as much about learning a new skill — data — as it was about working as a team.</span></p>
<p>If you have yet to take the plunge into the world of data journalism, here are three key points to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every story can be a data story</strong></li>
<li><strong>Every journalist can be a data journalist</strong></li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Every newsroom can produce kick-ass data projects</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">In addition to that, k</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">now your goals and know your audience when you take on a data project. Ask yourself w</span>hat you want to convey? What do you hope to accomplish? Once you have your vision, it&#8217;s time to roll up your sleeves and get busy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. Identify obstacles<br />
</span></strong>Ok, so now you have your idea. But what obstacles are in your way? We all have them. From finding the data, to crunching the numbers, to technology and knowledge, or making the pitch to your editor. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Here are some common examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is &#8220;dirty&#8221;</li>
<li>Story lacks focus</li>
<li>Too many moving pieces</li>
<li>Breaking news or daily news monopolizes time</li>
<li>Lack of coordination</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Data is <em>still</em> dirty</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">How do you get past these obstacles? Know what you could be up against and plan your attack. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Get into a “data state of mind” and get the ideas flowing.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We all have ideas, and those ideas can come from anywhere. But in a small newsroom, as Grovum pointed out, they should come from <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. Choose skills over tools<br />
</span></strong>Start with skills — who knows what? Use the known skills to jumpstart or aid the process, <em>then</em> identify the tools. As the projects begin to flow, pick a few tools and stick with them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">3. Think visually<br />
</span></strong>Let’s show our audience what we’ve got by coming up with a way to display the content that is useful. I’m currently experimenting with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, an interactive map tool. At first attempt, it seems fairly user-friendly. Other recommendations include <a href="http://piktochart.com/">Piktochart</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Fusion Tables</a> and <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4. Data every day<br />
</span></strong>Ask questions related to data. Think about the details that can help your coverage. The more data you have from the start, the easier the ideas will flow.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">5. Stay organized<br />
</span></strong>Use <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> to manage your time, meetings and deadlines. Or t<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">ry <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>. I created an account following this session and have been experimenting with it since. A great organizing and communicating tool, especially when working on projects that include multiple departments or newsrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>6. Always be learning</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s not forget that we are journalists. It&#8217;s safe to assume many of us got into this business because we want to learn more and ask questions. Look at data journalism and digital tools like this: New tools, new skills, new knowledge = more fun, more journalism. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">One thing that Grovum said during the session has stuck with me. She said, “On every data project someone should always be learning.” </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">How important is data to digital journalism right now? I believe this tweet from my colleague Daniel Tedford sums it up best: </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>If i could describe <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ONA13&amp;src=hash">#ONA13</a> &#8211; my first &#8211; in 3 words, they would be: Data, data and data</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p>Every winter, hundreds of data journalists gather to share ideas, stories and techniques from the bleeding edge of investigative reporting, data visualization and the development of news applications. Those who attend Investigative Reporters and Editors&#8217; annual Computer-Assisted Reporting conference include the brightest and most generous minds pursuing data journalism for the best news organizations in the world.</p>
<p>This winter, you have a chance to represent your Digital First newsroom and join them in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Ask any journalist who has attended the conference (colloquially referred to as NICAR, for the National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting, a part of IRE), and she or he will tell you the experience has proven invaluable year after year. But no matter how much you want to learn a difficult new skill, like SQL or web scraping, paying to get to a conference can be another challenge altogether.</p>
<p>With that economic reality in mind, over the summer, we created the Digital First Represents program to send journalists from our newsrooms to high-value conferences to learn and share knowledge. We are sending five journalists from across the country to <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/">ONA13 in Atlanta</a> in a few weeks and <a title="Design on the mind? DFM wants you for SND" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/26/dfm-represents-snd-workshop/">two more to SND in Louisville</a>. And now we want to choose three more from three different newsrooms to go to NICAR. These three will be awarded with registration to NICAR14 and hotel lodging during the conference in Baltimore, Feb. 27 to March 2.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not just looking for people who want to go and eat crabs and pit beef and drink Natty Boh. We&#8217;ll consider people of any experience or skill level who are eager to learn. We want to send people who want to participate in the DFM data journalism community. We want to help our journalists who are desperately trying to learn specific skills or pursue stories that could benefit from the wisdom and training they&#8217;d receive at NICAR. Each entrant in the contest will pitch a data-driven project that they will complete and publish after the conference, using techniques they learn in Baltimore.</p>
<p>We want people who recognize the value of strong, investigative journalism and the smart use of data in reporting and who will share what they learn with their colleagues. We are looking for ambassadors who can bottle up the tips and excitement at NICAR and bring that back to their newsrooms. Each of our three winners will be expected to live tweet at least two NICAR session and to contribute at least two blog posts here on InsideThunderdome.com about what they learned at the conference.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT NICAR14</strong><br />

		<description><![CDATA[Ben Goessling and MaryJo Webster of the Pioneer Press win the DFMie for data journalism for their analysis of homeruns at Target Field, new home of the Minnesota Twins.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/target_field-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="target_field" /></p><p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bengoessling">Ben Goessling</a> and <a href="http://maryjowebster.pressfolios.com/">MaryJo Webster</a> of the Pioneer Press win the DFMie for data journalism for their <a href="http://www.twincities.com/1000/ci_20398152/target-field-factor-minnesota-twins-sluggers-constantly-battle">analysis of homeruns at Target Field</a>, new home of the Minnesota Twins.</p>
<p>Their editors’ nomination explains the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Making excuses for the Minnesota Twins is a regional pastime. But, as in any good sports town, the excuses often come backed with nothing but air.</p>
<p>So Twins Writer Ben Goessling and Computer-Assisted Reporting Editor MaryJo Webster applied hard data to a wisp of a theory: Perhaps the Twins&#8217; horrible home run production in their new ballpark had less to do with the oft-discussed &#8220;batter&#8217;s eye&#8221; and more to do with the wind.</p>
<p>Ben collected a massive amount of weather data and Twins’ data about home-run production. The result, paired with MaryJo&#8217;s knowledge, was a smart, interactive look at the topic that generated buzz among fans and pundits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why they chose the project as a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Baseball is a game of stats – and the Pioneer Press delivered plenty of them for Twins fans to consider and debate in its excellent data-driven package on hitting and the wind at Target Field. The Pioneer Press team chose an original topic, mined it from every angle and presented what they found in a well-written story, a set of impressive graphics and game-by-game data summaries. And they didn&#8217;t just present the data; they used it to offer informed advice and commentary on how the Twins should harness the wind to their advantage.</p></blockquote>
