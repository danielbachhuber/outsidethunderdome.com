				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-9.26.49-AM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 9.26.49 AM" /></p><p>Jason Henry of the Morning Journal won the DFMie for the Midwest region for his series on the rise of heroin addiction in the Lorain, Ohio, area.</p>
<p>Editor Tom Skoch explained in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>In three stories published over two days, Jason Henry’s series “Hooked” highlights a severe <a title="Hooked: Drug overdose deaths surge locally" href="http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2013/01/20/news/doc50fb742c8a93d501612540.txt">drug overdose death problem</a> that has arisen locally, linked to heroin. It also shows the <a title="Hooked: Spotlight on drug abuse ..." href="http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2013/01/20/news/doc50fb73bf71fd2133901214.txt">impact of addiction on one family</a>, and it highlights the alarming <a title="Hooked: Realities of drug addiction ..." href="http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2013/01/21/news/doc50fcc7df10786807373050.txt">shortage of local programs to help people overcome addiction</a>.</p>
<p>The series also spotlights efforts by local officials to bring about a change in Ohio law to put an overdose antidote drug into the hands of more first-responders, such as police, to save more lives. The series was conceived and written by Jason Henry, who delivered a well-polished set of stories for publication.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges praised Henry&#8217;s work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Detecting change in a community and making sense of it for readers is at the heart of good reporting. General assignments reporter Jason Henry did just that for the Morning Journal as he explored the rise of drug-related deaths in his community. He effectively used experts and victims of drug abuse to provide a clear picture of how a drug epidemic works and what it ultimately costs. He also showed how current Ohio law prevents some access to an important drug antidote. It also shows how ill-prepared communities are in taking on the spread of drug abuse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good series on an epidemic that&#8217;s affected the local community. The stories showed all facets of the problem, from the personal story of someone suffering from drug addiction and how it affects their family to problems with local programs meant to help people overcome addiction. Really good public-service journalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other Midwest finalists were Oakland Press Local News Editor Julie Jacobson Hines for her leadership in producing a print-only product, &#8220;A Ride Down Memory Lane: A History of the Automobile Industry&#8221; and a Pioneer Press team for coverage of a St. Paul extreme sports event, <a title="Crashed Ice" href="http://photos.twincities.com/2013/01/24/photos-red-bull-crashed-ice-opens-competition/#3">Crashed Ice</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[As gun control and gun-owners' rights became one of the hottest issues in the nation, Josh Richman examined California's long history of gun control. His thorough reporting won the January DFMie for the Bay Area News Group.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-8.57.44-AM-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 8.57.44 AM" /></p><p>As gun control and gun-owners&#8217; rights became one of the hottest issues in the nation, <a title="Josh Richman" href="https://twitter.com/Josh_Richman">Josh Richman</a> examined California&#8217;s long history of gun control. His thorough reporting won the January DFMie for the Bay Area News Group.</p>
<p>Managing Editor/Content Bert Robinson explained the project in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>California occupies an interesting place in the gun control debate &#8212; much of what&#8217;s being debated on a national level, from the assault weapons ban to enhanced background checks to a limit on the size of ammunition magazines &#8212; is already the law here. BANG political reporter Josh Richman is capitalizing on the California experience, writing about national gun control issues with the benefit of California&#8217;s triumphs and struggles. In mid January, he jumped on one of the biggest issues that Congress must tackle &#8212; one, frankly, that California has never really solved: <a title="Assault weapons: What are they and should they be banned?" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_22396050">How do you define an assault weapon</a>?</p>
<p>Josh&#8217;s story plumbed the history of the California law, and an accompanying <a title="Assault rifle graphic" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/politics-government/ci_22398189">graphic</a> (below) by Chuck Todd and Karl Kahler showed where California ended up and how that works in practice (not as logically as we might wish).</p>
<p>Josh&#8217;s second piece, on Jan. 31, examined <a title="California's gun background-check system could be national model" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22483537">California&#8217;s background check system</a>, showing how much more rigorous it is than the current national model. Josh dug up numbers on how often applicants fail the background check &#8212; not often, as it turns out, but more often in California than elsewhere. Another sharp graphic, this time by Doug Griswold, walks readers through the way the system works.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The judges &#8212; winners of December DFMies &#8212; praised the results:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The timely stories do California readers a service by explaining the state&#8217;s laws and their effectiveness in a fairhanded manner &#8212; a position that&#8217;s pretty hard to achieve with this heated issue. The accompanying graphics are interesting and helpful. The stories were inspired by national headlines but benefited from good research, experience and observation.</p>
<p>They took a very newsy national story and found a way to localize it in an informative and interesting way. Although a lot of people are aware of the gun debate, many people don&#8217;t know what the different types of guns look like. The graphic adds a visual element to the story while also offering more information. The in-depth analysis in both stories offered a lot detail about gun laws that isn&#8217;t available in most of the national stories on the topic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>

<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The work is both explanatory and investigative and represents vital public service to his readers. He provided them with solid, in-depth, factual information about a raging debate marked by inaccuracies and emotional arguments on all sides. Josh cuts through that with good, useful information.</p>
<p>I find his work an example of journalism at its best. I learned a lot about the issue from reading Josh&#8217;s stories and from the excellent graphic that accompanied one of them. I will be showing this work to some of my own staff members in hopes that our readers can benefit from similar stories.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other BANG finalists for January were Mark Conley&#8217;s <a title="San Francisco 49ers coverage" href="www.mercurynews.com/49ers">pre-Super Bowl coverage of the San Francisco 49ers</a> and Mike Murphy and Ann Tatko-Peterson for their internal reports on digital traffic, with tips on what&#8217;s working well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/mercurynews1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="mercurynews-cost-of-dying" /></p><p>Death is always a difficult topic to approach, both in journalism and everyday life. That&#8217;s why Dai Sugano and Lisa Krieger’s ongoing <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/">Cost of Dying</a> series at the San Jose Mercury News is such an impressive work of journalism, and more than worthy of a DFMie. The stories on end of life care combine data and analysis with heart-wrenching articles, photos and videos to bring this important issue to the attention of readers’ heads and hearts.</p>
<p>The most recent chapters of the year-long series focus on the death of nurse Gayla Caliva. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_22200117/video-cost-dying-one-nurses-end-life-choice-was">Words</a>, <a href="http://photos.mercurynews.com/2012/12/29/cost-of-dying-series/#24">pictures </a>and a <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid666183218001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAAAF4Pseg~,AuucDCy8Ix1UPicfCPj7dA9Gnq6ygLQJ&amp;bctid=2036452941001">15-minute documentary</a> follow the retired nurse through her final days in comfort at home instead of in a hospital undergoing costly dialysis treatment. An earlier entry looks at the emotional and financial challenges for at-home caregivers, again in both <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_22102247/cost-dying-at-home-caregivers-face-challenges-sacrifice">text</a> and <a href="http://bcove.me/luqjv48e">video</a>. Krieger also provides a comprehensive debriefing on <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_22278023/cost-dying-discovering-better-way-final-days">all the lessons learned</a> from the series, including her personal experiences from her own father’s death.</p>
<p>The series&#8217; impact has traveled far beyond the Bay Area, as readers from all over the country have joined in a Facebook comment stream on the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/">section page</a> sharing their own personal experiences and revelations dealing with the cost of a relatives&#8217; death. The Mercury-News also went the extra mile to answer its local readers&#8217; questions by hosting a series of public <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_22270221/advance-health-care-planning-workshops-offered-by-bay?source=pkg">advance health care workshops</a> around the Bay Area.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Mobile home owners in Marin, California, may want to thank reporter Nels Johnson. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/marin1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Investigations-Marin-IJ" /></p><p>Mobile home owners in Marin, California, may want to thank reporter Nels Johnson. His investigative reporting for the Marin Independent-Journal helped reveal that many local residents were paying property taxes for land owned by other people. Local counties and school districts are investigating more than 1,858 tax bills for 1,858 mobile home and houseboat owners with parcel tax charges have been <a href="http://www.marinij.com/ci_22132264">flagged for review</a>. This variety of public service investigative journalism directly improves people&#8217;s lives and definitely deserves a DFMie.</p>
<p>As one judge noted,</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The research was airtight and the thorny issue was presented in a clear, concise way. This is a real scoop &#8211; something that might not have seen the light of day if not for hard work from a journalist. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 2/18 </strong>Following the Independent-Journal&#8217;s publication of the story, officials were set scrambling to <a href="http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_22550782/600-marin-houseboat-and-mobile-homeowners-share-500">refund $500,000 in tax payments</a> erroneously collected by county agencies.</p>
<p>As one reader wrote in an email to Nels,</p>
<blockquote><p>On behalf of all the mobile home owners and I&#8217;m sure the floating home residents, thank you for following through with this story and making it happen. It&#8217;s really a big deal in terms of the money that has to be refunded.</p></blockquote>

<p>The amount of time Brown spent learning about the issue was readily evident throughout the package; it was clear the journalism was produced from a position of knowledge and authority. Complimented by a four-part video series and a live chat, Brown&#8217;s coverage was accessible to readers with varying amounts of background knowledge, as he also produced an easy-to-read &#8216;What we found&#8217; breakout feature to accompany the package.</p>

Such has been the case for the El Paso Times since the city announced its intention to buy the newspaper’s building. The purchase is part of a broader controversial effort to demolish City Hall to clear the way for a Triple A baseball stadium.</p>
<p>As the City Council was preparing to finalize the purchase of the Times building for $14 million, El Paso Times journalists obtained the city’s appraisal of the building and discovered the appraised value was $3.7 million below the purchase price. In a stunning display of incompetence, city officials hadn’t really read the appraisal until Times reporter Marty Schladen started asking about it. Although the discovery risked costing the company several million dollars, the Times broke the story and has continued to follow the issue. Almost a month later, the fate of the sale is still uncertain.</p>
