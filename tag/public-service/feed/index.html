				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Torrington-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Register Citizen illustration" /></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>The Register Citizen</strong> in Torrington, Conn., won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">Public Service DFMie</a> for its reporting and commentary on a rape case that included bullying of the 13-year-old victims in social media.</span></p>
<p>The nomination cites the work of <strong>Jessica Glenza</strong>, <strong>Tom Cleary</strong>,<strong> Tom Caprood</strong>,<strong> John Berry</strong> and <strong>Matt DiRienzo</strong>. The rules of the DFMies call for nominations of work by more than four staff members to be staff awards.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The staff of a 5,000-circulation daily newspaper in a small town in Northwest Connecticut pursued a routine court story with traditional investigative reporting and social media research until it had laid out a community culture of abuse of women and children generations in the making, and a police and school department that placed athletics, public perception and fear of litigation above protection of students.</span></p>
<p>After Torrington High School football players Edgar Gonzalez and Joan Toribio were each charged with statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, dozens of fellow students used social media to bully the victims. The newspaper printed examples of Twitter messages from students including fellow athletes and honor roll students that referred to the case as “young men acting like boys and girls acting like whores,” and blaming the victims for “snitching.”</p>
<p>By the end of 2013, seven teens associated with Torrington High School football had been charged with rape. Even after the bullying of the 13-year-old victims became a national story, The Register Citizen reported on students at Torrington High School rallying behind the accused football players and referring to statutory rape as a crime akin to “jaywalking.” Torrington had been ignoring a law aimed at protecting students from bullying, and repeatedly passed up opportunities to protect students and send the right public message about rape and consent due to fear of exposure to lawsuits.</p>
<p>The newspaper’s reporting and editorials showed how the local police department perpetuated this culture by referring to the case as “consensual” and “not forcible.” When warrants were unsealed, The Register Citizen detailed how alcohol was poured down the throat of one of the 13-year-old girls, how her arm was bent behind her back during the assault and how she repeatedly said “No.”</p>
<p>Finally, The Register Citizen’s reporting, editorials and decision-making on this coverage revealed a disconnect in and sparked a statewide and national discussion of how media can perpetuate “rape culture” in how it covers sexual assault. The Register Citizen’s main and much larger local daily newspaper competitor, the Republican-American of Waterbury, referred to the case as a “tryst” in a lead front page headline. That newspaper also wrote an editorial blaming the girls’ parents for the rape, because they should have raised girls who don’t sneak out of the house and meet 18-year-old men, and its editor spoke at a “community conversation” on the topic about how the victims “had a past” and that social media was to blame for “ruining the lives” of the students who bullied them.</p>
<p>The Register Citizen’s reporting on rape culture in Torrington was all the more remarkable considering the size and experience level of this small newsroom (6 reporters, 3 editors), and the hostility it faced from local school and police officials for breaking the story (being shut out for months from official comment on stories while officials talked to the paper’s local daily competitor, not to mention the New York Times and CNN).</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Judges&#8217; comments: </span></p>
<blockquote><p>In the public service category, the judges choose Jessica Glenza, Tom Cleary, Tom Caprood, John Berry and Matt DiRienzo of the Register Citizen as the winners. Their challenge to the primacy of Torrington&#8217;s high school football hero culture as well as to a community and police culture of turning a blind eye to the serious problem of sexual assault was built on facts and solid reporting, and their response to the criticism of their coverage was equally solid. We especially liked their &#8220;FAQs&#8221;, which clearly summarized what they knew &#8212; and equally important, what they didn&#8217;t (yet) know. We admired how effectively this small &#8220;little engine that could&#8221; newsroom raised awareness of a huge issue in their community, and changed the conversation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Glenza won the Journalist of the Year DFMie for small newsrooms in large part for her reporting on the rape/bullying case. Cleary was a finalist for Mid-Level Editor of the Year. The reporting on the rape/bullying case won a <a title="Teamwork marks March DFMie winners" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/05/28/teamwork-marks-march-dfmie-winners/">March DFMie</a>. The Connecticut newsrooms won four 2014 DFMies.</p>

Krieger" href="https://twitter.com/lisamkrieger">Lisa M. Krieger</a> and <a title="Dai Sugano" href="http://www.daisugano.com">Dai Sugano</a> of the San Jose Mercury News win the DFMie for public service for their <a title="Cost of Dying" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying">Cost of Dying</a> project.</p>
<p>The nomination by their editors explained the project and its impact:</p>
<blockquote><p>The San Jose Mercury News is proud to nominate reporter Lisa M. Krieger and photojournalist Dai Sugano for a 2012 DFMie in Public Service for their yearlong examination of the physical, financial and emotional “Cost of Dying.”</p>
<p>Through powerful narratives, interactive online graphics and poignant videos, the nine-part series demystifies the excruciating choices that so many of us face but so few of us understand as we and our loved ones encounter the end of life.</p>
<p>When Krieger’s ailing father went into the hospital in July 2011, she found herself by his side, <a title="It's hard to reject care even as costs soar" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_19898736">struggling to determine which advanced medical procedures to authorize, and which to avoid</a>. What would he want? What could she justify? And did the cost – the bill for the final 10 days of his care came to $323,000 – make any sense at all?</p>
<p>Through her eloquent and universal voice, Krieger drew hundreds of reader responses in emails, online comments and letters that led to a remarkable series. The highlights included:</p>
<p>“<a title="Planning for a good death" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_20344805/cost-dying-planning-good-death-from-advance-directive">Choosing How You Die</a>” &#8212; A story and step-by-step online graphic that educated readers on how to take control of their lives with crucial end-of-life planning tools.</p>
<p>“<a title="At life's end, care differs" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_22143099/cost-dying-at-lifes-end-care-differs">At life’s end, care differs</a>’’ &#8212; A data analysis of Bay Area hospitals that revealed how we die – and how much it costs – depends largely on where we get care.</p>
<p>“<a title="Gayla's Goodbye" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_22200117/video-cost-dying-one-nurses-end-life-choice-was">Gayla’s Goodbye</a>’’ – A video (above) and photo essay that shared the extraordinary insights of 70-year-old Gayla Caliva in her final months of life, after she chose to forgo treatment for kidney failure and die at home in the company of loved ones.</p>
<p>“<a title="Feeding Dilemma" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cost-of-dying/ci_21905632/cost-dying-simple-act-feeding-poses-painful-choices">Feeding Dilemma</a>” &#8212; A story that explored how the breakthrough feeding tube, designed to help ailing infants, evolved into a morally questionable means of prolonging life that studies now show is more harm than help for many elderly people.</p>
<p>Over the course of the series, Krieger and Sugano received hundreds of responses like this one from a woman who had just made the decision to forgo a feeding tube for a loved one, in essence allowing him to die: “I really was doubting my choice to keep the tube out, and this (story) was an answer to a prayer, literally, that has helped me know that I have done the right thing.’’</p>
<p>In the end, the series drew on lessons from readers, health care professionals and policymakers to prescribe a cure for America’s sorry state of dying.</p>
<p>It is a rare privilege for a news organization to engage in such a meaningful conversation with its readers. That conversation continues: Krieger has moderated panel discussions and spoken to groups throughout California. The project won first place honors from the <a title="AHCJ award winners" href="http://healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=163#.Uc8esz5AQ6E">Association of Health Care Journalists</a> and <a title="Northern California SPJ award winners" href="http://www.spjnorcal.org/new/2012/10/02/check-out-this-years-excellence-in-journalism-award-winners/">Northern California Society of Professional Journalists</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The project also has won two monthly DFMies already, <a title="Cost of Dying Series Combines Emotion and Data" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/san-jose-mercury/cost-dying-series-combines-emotion-data/">one for Krieger and Sugano&#8217;s work</a> and <a title="Cost of Dying iPad app wins a DFMie" href="http://www.thinglink.com/scene/402200721027497986">one for Paiching Wei&#8217;s development of an iPad app</a>.</p>
<p>Judges explained why they chose Cost of Dying as the public service winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>The San Jose Mercury News series Cost of Dying, pegged to a touching first-person account of a reporter&#8217;s loss of her father, is an exceptional example of public service journalism. Lisa M. Krieger and Dai Sugano tackled the issue from beginning to end, explaining the challenges involved in end-of-life care with concrete examples. We especially appreciated that the series offered readers key information on how to face and avoid some of the toughest problems they themselves might face in such situations. The content helped demystify some of the incredibly difficult choices that dying people and their care-givers must make &#8211; ones that everyone encounters but so few of us are prepared for. The expert story telling and multimedia elements also greatly enhanced the series.</p></blockquote>
