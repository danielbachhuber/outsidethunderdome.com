<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stevebuttry">@stevebuttry</a> dumb question. We&#8217;re still expected to edit work with the same rigor we&#8217;ve used for print, right? Grammar, AP style, etc.?</p>
<p>— mikec (@delcomike) <a href="https://twitter.com/delcomike/statuses/435693446737952768">February 18, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Good question, actually. I answered in a few tweets, but said it would probably be worth a blog post. So here goes:</p>
<p>Everything has changed in newsrooms and <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://projectunbolt.com" target="_blank">Project Unbolt</a> is designed to accelerate that change in Digital First newsrooms, &#8220;unbolting&#8221; from our newspaper-factory processes and developing new processes (and standards) for a newsroom primarily focused on producing digital content.</p>
<p><strong>The editing process needs to change</strong><br />
We still want rigorous editing, but how we edit will certainly change.<br />
<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12943 alignright" alt="Project Unbolt logo" src="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/project_unbolt-logo.png?w=123" width="123" height="150" />If &#8220;rigor&#8221; means multiple layers of editing, like newspapers enjoyed back in the day, I believe that won&#8217;t be returning. Newsroom staff cuts have already reduced editing ranks, and Project Unbolt isn&#8217;t going to change that. If we&#8217;re successful in growing digital revenue, we can stop the staff reductions and perhaps grow someday. But unbolting needs to happen, whatever size staff we can maintain.</p>
<p>I do expect every journalist who handles any copy, starting with the reporter, to edit rigorously. Absolutely we need to write and edit grammatically and follow <a title="AP Stylebook" href="http://www.apstylebook.com/">AP style</a> (or a local newsroom&#8217;s style) in our stories. And <a title="The Verification Handbook is now available" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/the-verification-handbook-is-now-available/" target="_blank">verify</a> our facts.</p>
<p>As I have noted before, reporters (and photojournalists who write cutlines and occasionally stories) need to <a title="Copy editing: It’s taught me a lot, but it has to change" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/05/25/copy-editing-its-taught-me-a-lot-but-it-has-to-change/" target="_blank">take responsibility for the quality of their own writing</a>.</p>
<p>Too many reporters with strong news-gathering skills were carried through the years by editors who rewrote and polished and made their writing look better than what they turned in. Well, we don&#8217;t have as many layers of editors as we used to, and the editors we have don&#8217;t have as much time to do your job for you as they used to, and sometimes you need to file live content directly without editing. Reporters should polish their writing skills and turn in clean stories. They should take a moment to read and edit quickly before tweeting or posting in a liveblog.</p>
<p>So in this sense, I think we need to <em>raise</em> our rigor: Reporters should turn in stories that are ready for publication.</p>
<p><strong>Editing in real-time</strong><br />
In <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/tips-on-liveblogging-for-journalists/" target="_blank">liveblogging</a>, blogging and use of social media, reporters and photojournalists may be posting content with no editing. That&#8217;s not going to be as clean as rigorously edited copy that gets a look from a fresh set of eyes and a professional editor before publication. That&#8217;s too bad. We need to do all of those things and requiring an editor to edit them isn&#8217;t practical. All journalists should rigorously, but quickly, edit their own tweets or updates before posting to social media.</p>
<p>But Mike&#8217;s an editor and I&#8217;m sure he was asking primarily about editors editing copy they didn&#8217;t write.</p>
<p><strong>Editors who edit copy</strong><br />
Stories that are not being covered live should be edited with rigor and swiftness. We need to be realistic about what &#8220;rigor&#8221; means today. Back when I was an assigning editor for the Des Moines Register and Kansas City Times in the 1980s, I would typically read a story three times before passing it along to the copy desk for more editing. I would read once without making many, if any, changes, just trying to understand the story and get a sense for what the reporter was saying. Then I&#8217;d edit a second time for meaning and structure, perhaps asking the reporter to clarify a few things, or clarifying them myself, and perhaps moving parts of the story around to make better sense or flow. I might do some grammar and style editing in that first or second pass, but the final pass was putting on the polish: checking grammar and style, tightening wordy or redundant phrases, <a title="Make every word count: Tips for polishing and tightening copy" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/make-every-word-count-tips-for-polishing-and-tightening-copy/" target="_blank">making every word count</a>, <a title="Strong from the start: advice for writing leads" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/strong-from-the-start-advice-for-writing-leads/" target="_blank">challenging the lead</a> to make it crisp and to the point.</p>
<p>Often on deadline, though, I needed to give a story one quick edit, where I tried to achieve all the work of those three passes I&#8217;d make through a story when I had time. I applied a lot of rigor to the story, but I applied it quickly. I don&#8217;t think many editors today have the luxury very often of three reads through a story. I think they are more likely applying the kind of rigor I used to apply on deadline.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a>, where I&#8217;m working for several weeks this month and next to help in <a title="DFM’s Project Unbolt will wrench newsrooms free from print worklow" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/29/project-unbolt-wrenching-newsrooms-free-print-workflow-culture/" target="_blank">unbolting</a>, the web production team includes a copy editor, whose job is to apply rigorous editing to content we post digitally, sometimes before it goes online and sometimes quickly after it goes online in a breaking news situation.</p>
<p>In at least one respect, I expect editing to become <em>more </em>rigorous: As reporters self-edit their stories and as editors edit, both should watch for places where we should <a title="Plagiarism and Fabrication Summit: Journalists need to use links to show our work" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/plagiarism-and-fabrication-summit-journalists-need-to-use-links-to-show-our-work/">link to sources</a> and other relevant links that can add context and depth.</p>
<p><strong>Be rigorous about ethics</strong><br />
Another area where I believe editors need to be more rigorous: Occasionally (at least once a day) you should Google a unique phrase in a reporter&#8217;s story to confirm that a reporter&#8217;s work is original. I believe the vast majority — all, hopefully — of our staff members are ethical journalists who file original work. But editors should not take that for granted. If something in a story raises a suspicion, you absolutely should check a phrase — or a few phrases — to make sure the reporter isn&#8217;t stealing from other sources. And occasionally you should Google a phrase or two from the work of reporters you trust. As Ronald Reagan said in a different context, <a title="Trust but verify" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">trust but verify</a>.</p>
<p>(For more on detecting and preventing plagiarism, see the ebook <a title="Telling the Truth and Nothing But" href="http://www.rjionline.org/sites/default/files/aces_telling_the_truth_1.pdf">Telling the Truth and Nothing But</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>The crowdsourced copy desk</strong><br />
One more aspect where I hope that our editing is more rigorous: I hope we are quick to correct errors (including grammar, spelling and style errors) as the public or fellow journalists point them out. I call it the crowdsourced copy desk (I earnestly invite you to point out any errors you spot in this post or elsewhere in my work).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use that phrase flippantly to suggest that the crowd can replace copy editors. But the crowd has always complained, usually too late to do anything about the errors they caught. In my days as editor of newspapers, I probably received more complaints about seemingly small editing errors (even when we had multiple layers of rigorous editing) than I received complaints about liberal editorial positions or big mistakes. It was always too late to fix those typos in print, which didn&#8217;t merit corrections. But we can and should fix typos the public points out in our digital products (and sometimes we&#8217;ll get alerted soon enough to fix them before the story makes print). We want our editing to be rigorous enough that the crowd has nothing to complain about, but our last layer of rigor must be responding to the complaints.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also add that, while I want excellent grammar and want our content to follow AP style (unless we&#8217;ve made a choice to follow a different style on some matters), neither of those concerns ranks as high in my priorities as accuracy or clarity. I&#8217;ve taught <a title="Grammar matters" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/grammar-matters/">grammar workshops and blogged on how to use <em>who </em>and <em>whom</em></a>, and I want subjects and verbs to agree. But my priority list is too crowded to fret over a misused <em>who </em>or disagreeing pronoun and antecedent that don&#8217;t change the meaning of the story.</p>
<p>I remember plenty of examples of those types of errors that snuck past editors back in the day when we had multiple levels of assigning editors, top editors, copy editors and slots who edited copy rigorously before publication. Rigor never meant perfection, merely the pursuit of it. We don&#8217;t have as many editors as we used to, but I still want rigor from every journalist in editing what we produce, even (and especially) in self-editing your own work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Tim-ORourke-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tim O&#039;Rourke" /></p><p>DFMie judges chose <a title="Tim O'Rourke" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timothyorourke">Tim O&#8217;Rourke</a> of the Bay Area News Group as Copy Editor of the Year.</p>
<p>The nomination by his editors explains O’Rourke’s important role:</p>
<blockquote><p>A year ago, Tim O&#8217;Rourke considered leaving the &#8220;newspaper&#8221; business. Today, he is senior copy desk chief for digital and print content for the Bay Area News Group. As the lengthy title implies, Tim holds arguably the most complicated job in today’s newsroom.</p>
<p>He’s still a traditional copy desk chief, making the biggest catches each week, shepherding style guidelines, slotting the newspapers’ most important stories and writing headlines as strong or as witty as anyone.</p>
<p>But he is also one of the news group’s driving forces in the push to digital. Tim recognized the importance of clicks right away, and he championed the creation of “clickboxes,” files paired with our stories that we link to online and which have resulted in hundreds of thousands of hits we wouldn’t have otherwise garnered. He did his homework and has been a leader in teaching others about SEO. He has led training sessions on these and other topics.</p>
<p>Tim was the major conduit for a workflow change that allowed us to focus our priorities on digital platforms, despite creating much more work for himself.</p>
<p>In addition, Tim writes the work schedules for nearly 40 employees and acts as a liaison to other departments, serves on many committees, devises workflows and administers evaluations. Yes, he’s busy. But he’s a funny, humble, newsroom-type guy whose demanding standards make everyone around him a better journalist. We are excited to nominate Tim O’Rourke for DFM’s Copy Editor of the Year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The judges explained their choice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tim O&#8217;Rourke wins the DFMie for Copy Editor of the Year for crafting clear prose, driving digital transformation and maintaining high standards across the Bay Area News Group&#8217;s multiple platforms. His headlines were not only crisp and clever, they were also appropriate and representative of the accompanying stories. On the humorous side, we got a kick out of &#8216;Ouchville&#8217; and &#8216;Gaps     anger    drivers.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Copy Editor of the Year were <a title="Philip Maramba" href="https://twitter.com/DailyMailPhilip">Philip Maramba</a> of the Charleston Daily Mail and <a title="Jeanette Dunn" href="https://twitter.com/DunnJeanette">Jeanette Dunn</a> of the Los Angeles News Group.</p>
<p>O’Rourke leads copy desk operations for the San Jose Mercury News, Contra Costa Times, Oakland Tribune and other Digital First Media newspapers and digital platforms in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>He came to the Times in 2007 and has worked in many positions and on even more publications. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Saint Mary&#8217;s College of California and graduated from the University of Oregon Graduate School of Journalism in 2006. When he&#8217;s not editing, organizing and helping manage the copy and design desks, O&#8217;Rourke writes restaurant reviews and other Food+Wine stories for the BANG features department.</p>
<p>He is getting married in August to his fiancee, Kate. Together, they try to keep in line a miniature dachshund, Dottie, and a pug named Fuji.</p>
