				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/Mile-High-Mamas-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Mile High Mamas" /></p><p><a title="Mile High Mamas" href="http://www.milehighmamas.com">Mile High Mamas</a> wins the DFMie for Community Blog, the only DFMie not awarded to a Digital First Media staff member.</p>
<p>DFM encourages newsrooms to network with community blogs, showcasing their local content on news sites and driving traffic to other outlets with news and information about community life. This award recognizes the success of the Denver blog founded by Amber Johnson.</p>
<p>Denver Post editors explained the success of the blog in their nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mile High Mamas was created as an entertaining community resource for area moms. The site includes regular posts by some of Colorado&#8217;s most popular Mommy Bloggers, a message board, monthly cutest kid contest, and a Mama Drama advice column. They also hold regular giveaways and product reviews.</p>
<p>The site was the brainchild of Amber Johnson, and she is the glue that keeps the whole thing running. She is constantly updating the blog postings so that different voices are represented on the pages, and gives readers many reasons to keep coming back. And the metrics year over year speak for themselves: 2012 pageviews: 689,078; 2011 pageviews: 456,369.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained their choice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our pick for community blogger is Mile High Mamas, a wonderful blog with a compelling, entertaining mix of personal pieces, intriguing questions, spotlights on events and tips and far more. Parenting blogs are a digital staple, but many aren&#8217;t worth the time their authors or readers put into them. But Mile High Mamas, which offers posts that are consistently useful, not to mention a robust forum and a cute kids photo contest/gallery that&#8217;s hard not to click through at least occasionally. This is a blog that&#8217;s grown into a community that readers have made their own, and that any town would envy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for best community blogger were <a title="Norm Pattis Blog" href="http://www.pattisblog.com/index.php?article=Who_Owns_New_Haven_s_Green__5317&amp;limit=10&amp;page=topic&amp;q=Who+Owns+New+Haven%5C%27s+Green%3F">Norm Pattis</a> of the <a title="New Haven Register Community Media Lab" href="http://www.nhregister.com/blogs/medialab/">New Haven Register&#8217;s Community Media Lab</a> and Blake Stough, whose <a title="Preserving York" href="http://www.preservingyork.com/">Preserving York</a> is part of the York Daily Record&#8217;s <a title="York Blog" href="http://www.yorkblog.com/">York Blog</a> network.</p>
<p>Johnson launched Mile High Mamas in September 2007 with a team of dedicated Denver-area bloggers. It has grown from a simple blog to an online and offline community with regular events, a weekly newsletter, deals, contests and so much more.</p>

<p>Johnson is originally from Canada but spent a number of years working as a publicist for Utah’s ski and outdoor industry while moonlighting as a radio personality and travel writer. She started blogging in 2003 and has received various accolades including being selected as Microsoft&#8217;s accredited blogger at the 2010 Vancouver Games. In addition to running Mile High Mamas, Amber writes a regular column in The Denver Post&#8217;s $MART section, freelances as a family travel writer and also as a social media strategist. On a personal level, Amber is passionate about exploring the outdoors with her two children and is happily married to man obsessed with growing the Great Pumpkin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/reynolds-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Martin G. Reynolds addresses graduates of the Oakland Voices program, which he had originally conceived and has continued to run. Reynolds was named Innovator of the Year for this and other efforts like it. (George Kelly/Bay Area News Group)" /></p><div id="attachment_3198" style="width: 229px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/oakland-tribune/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/martin-reynolds/" rel="attachment wp-att-3198"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3198" alt="Martin G. Reynolds" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Martin-Reynolds-219x300.jpg" width="219" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Martin G. Reynolds</p></div>
<p>Judges chose <a title="Martin G. Reynolds" href="https://twitter.com/reynoldspost">Martin G. Reynolds</a> as Innovator of the Year for 2012 in Digital First Media newsrooms.</p>
<p>“The projects Martin has spearheaded continue to push the Tribune and Bay Area News Group in new and dynamic directions,&#8221; Oakland Tribune Managing Editor Pamela Turntine said of Reynolds, former editor of the Tribune. &#8220;He truly is an innovator in our organization and in our industry.”</p>
<p>The nomination by BANG East Bay Metro Editor Katherine Rowlands (lightly edited here) explains Reynolds&#8217; innovative leadership:</p>
<blockquote><p>Martin G. Reynolds, senior editor for community engagement for BANG and DFM’s Western Region, has been an innovator since he began his tenure at The Oakland Tribune as an intern in 1995. Since taking on his new role, Reynolds has spearheaded innovative projects that touch on key areas of emphasis for the company.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/oakland-tribune/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/oakland-voices-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3205"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3205" alt="Oakland Voices" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Oakland-Voices.png" width="101" height="126" /></a>Oakland Voices</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ground-breaking community storytelling project was co-founded by Reynolds after three years of planning. Since its start in 2010-11, OV has graduated 18 correspondents and published more than 200 stories online and in print, with only one minor correction.</li>
<li>Reynolds found funding for the project from The California Endowment and approached members of BANG’s Operating Committee to get in-kind support from Facilities, Online and IT.</li>
<li>Reynolds worked on every component of the project, including the training curriculum, participant selection, website design, editing and overseeing grant content goals.</li>
<li>Reynolds personally wrote the initial proposal to support the project and co-wrote the most recent grant that supported the 2012-13 class of OV correspondents.</li>
<li>Reynolds worked to assuage early concerns raised by assigning and line editors about the non-traditional tone of OV content, which ultimately led to greater acceptance.</li>
<li>The success of the 2012-13 OV class has fueled current efforts to expand Voices beyond Oakland to LANG and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Philanthropic supported reporting project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Over the past year, Reynolds has co-authored grants totaling $340,000 from The California Endowment to support reporting and community engagement efforts.</li>
<li>These funds went to support the most recent class of Oakland Voices, and the continuing work of Violence Reporting Fellow Scott Johnson, whose position was among the first endowed reporting beats in the nation. The <a title="Oakland Effect" href="http://www.oaklandeffect.com">Oakland Effect </a>project set a precedent for the creation of such beats, which have since been replicated in other news organizations such as The McClatchy Company.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">At Reynolds’ direction, the violence reporting fellowship also paired Johnson with Oakland Voices correspondents who produced a joint reporting assignment called </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" href="http://www.oaklandeffect.com/voices-oakland/">“Health in the Hood,”</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem"> where correspondents surveyed their neighborhoods to assess what makes them more or less healthy places to live. </span></li>
<li>The fellowship also included unique community engagement components such as a series of <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_20244226/www.siliconvalley.com/ces?source=inthenews">public forums</a>, webinars, and a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_20955082/fourm-seeks-start-conversation-about-gun-violence">forum Johnson moderated</a> on gun laws following the Aurora, Colorado shooting. These engagement efforts were highlighted as a model at a recent USC Annenberg School of Journalism conference.</li>
<li>Johnson has won three CNPA awards for his work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ongoing engagement work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since taking over his new role as engagement editor, with no designated budget or staff, Reynolds has set the standard for face-to-face engagement, planning 20 community engagement classes, eight engagement mixers, the Oakland Tribune grand opening and 11 public forums.</li>
<li>Reynolds recently penned “The Engagement Playbook” for editors in LANG which served as a blueprint for the group’s emerging engagement efforts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why Reynolds was the winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Innovation is often the first victim of tight budgets, so Martin G. Reynolds&#8217; achievement in nurturing various collaborative reporting and engagement projects for the Oakland Tribune is particularly impressive. Oakland Voices, which Reynolds co-founded, offers varied, often unexpected insights into the community it serves by members of that community. OaklandEffect.com provides a powerful, provocative perspective on crime of value to audiences well beyond the Bay Area. We also appreciate that he is extending his innovation to the equally important financial side, a rarity for journalists.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/NewsVroom-1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Among the many people from the York Daily Record and York Newspaper Co. who helped conduct an array of NewsVroom events are, from left, Assistant Sports Editor Brittany Wilson, GameTimePA Editor Elizabeth Jones, Books Editor Sarah Chain, Smart magazine Editor April Trotter, Managing Editor Randy Parker, Graphic Artist Samantha Dellinger and Visual Editor Eileen Joyce." /></p><p>Judges chose the <a href="http://ydr.com">York Daily Record</a>’s <a title="NewsVroom" href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/">NewsVroom</a> as the best community engagement project of 2012.</p>
<p>Editors explained the project in their nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spreading and sharing the message “The York Daily Record is not a newspaper” is a challenge we face head-on every day. To help with that community outreach effort and accelerate York County’s transition into the digital age, The York Daily Record/Sunday News launched <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/"><b>NewsVroom</b></a> in the late summer 2012.</p>
<p>NewsVroom is our mobile media lab – a new-media classroom on wheels. It’s equipped with laptops, smartphones, tablets and wi-fi and visits an array of community events; everything from <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/2012/10/30/the-newsvroom-stops-by-the-kennard-dale-vs-susquehannock-football-game/">high school football games</a> and emergency personnel groups to library workshops and Boy Scout pancake breakfasts.</p>
<p>With each visit, we create a hands-on experience to boost the public’s understanding of how both we and the public can use new technology to share news and information.</p>
<p>Since August we have shown the public how to take good photos with their smart phones, how to comment on our live blogs and download our apps. We’ve shown them how to share their photos and promote them on social media. We connected with readers through <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNewsVroom">our Twitter account</a>, our Facebook page and our blog. Most importantly, we’ve asked the community how we can better serve them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/2013/03/26/newsvroom-under-the-stars/#more-5025">And we’ve received some terrific feedback after our visits.</a></p>
<p>The NewsVroom’s reach has been so successful, we have been fielding requests for one to two community visits a week. We might just need another van.</p>
<p>Want to learn more? Here’s a <a href="http://sfy.co/fH1w">quick recap of the past six months. </a></p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why they chose York for the DFMie:</p>
<blockquote><p>The NewsVroom sticks out for its continued impact as an ongoing project; this is engagement that doesn&#8217;t end after a news cycle. It recognizes that face-to-face engagement can be more powerful than a clever hashtag, yet uses social media to facilitate and build upon those meaningful connections. We look forward to seeing what value this creates for the newsroom down the road, whether it&#8217;s power users of the app who were recruited at a football game, or community voices who become sources after becoming empowered in a class.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for the best community engagement project were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Diane Hoffman" href="https://twitter.com/diane5hoffman">Diane Hoffman</a>, <a title="Eileen Faust" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/eileenefaust">Eileen Faust</a> and <a title="Brandie Kessler" href="https://twitter.com/I_M_BrandieK">Brandie Kessler</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., for leading a <a title="Pottstown Mercury engages bloggers in community food drive" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/pottstown-mercury-engages-bloggers-in-community-food-drive/">community food drive</a>. Kessler, also a finalist for <a title="Martin G. Reynolds honored as Innovator of the Year" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/bay-area-news-group/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/">Innovator of the Year</a>, has joined the York Daily Record&#8217;s staff.</li>
<li>The Oakland Tribune for its <a title="Oakland Voices" href="http://oaklandvoices.us/">Oakland Voices</a> project (part of the winning nomination for <a title="Martin G. Reynolds honored as Innovator of the Year" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/bay-area-news-group/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/">Martin G. Reynolds as Innovator of the Year</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>After being informed of the NewsVroom selection as a DFMie winner, Managing Editor Randy Parker provided more detail on the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have racked up hundreds of miles on the NewsVroom. We have attended more than 60 events, and have dozens more scheduled. At this point, we do little to seek invitations. Rather, we try to avoid double- or triple-booking.</p>
<p>The Vroom has a proven track of moving the needle on specific mobile efforts. For instance, recently we noticed that few people had downloaded our very good Yard Sales PA mobile app. So on a Saturday, we held a &#8216;Vroom event at a community yard sale, taught people about the app, and saw the first day of double-digit downloads of the app.</p>
<p>Our GameTimePA mobile app sees spikes in the rate of downloads every time we attended high school sports events. we currently have about 8,000 downloads on the app. In May alone – a relatively slow month for such content, the app had 2,711 users racking up 202,461 page views.</p>
<p>Our next big push will come at the reenactment of the <a title="Gettysburg 150" href="http://www.ydr.com/gettysburg150">Battle of Gettysburg</a>. With up to 4 million visitors expected, our &#8216;Vroom team will show people the new<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gettysburg-150-facts-about/id646857431?mt=8"> iPad commemorative e-Magazine</a></span> we created for this event. And after that, the team will tout the new GameTimePA high school football preview iPad app.</p>
<p>NewsVroom on the blogs: Between <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/ydrinsider/">YDR Insider</a>, <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/varsity/">The Varsity Beat </a>and <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/">The NewsVroom</a>, our staff has used a variety of blogs to tell people where the &#8216;Vroom will be, engage with them while we are there, and share stories and photos about our visits afterward.</p>
<p>NewsVroom on social media: We routinely use the &#8216;Vroom&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNewsVroom">Twitter </a>and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewsVroom">Facebook</a> accounts to promote events. But we also use them as educational playgrounds. Safe areas, as it were, for the community to learn how to engage with us. We also use any of our regular staff accounts to socialize &#8216;Vroom efforts.</p></blockquote>

<p><a title="Kim McDaniel" href="http://linkedin.com/in/kimmcdaniel">Kim McDaniel</a> wins the DFMie for special contribution for her digital leadership in the Salt Lake Tribune newsroom.</p>
<p>Editor Nancy Conway explained McDaniel&#8217;s value to the Tribune in her nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kim McDaniel is The Salt Lake Tribune&#8217;s early adopter. Whenever a new wave heads our way, Kim is the one who paddles out to catch it. She&#8217;s been doing it since <a title="Salt Lake Tribune" href="http://www.sltrib.com/">sltrib.com</a> was created in 1995 as one of the first 10 newspaper web sites in the country.</p>
<p>First as a clerk, then as a web producer and now as the leader of our web team, Kim has pushed the newsroom to embrace the speed and the interactivity of the new paradigm. She wrote sltrib.com&#8217;s first online-only column, and later she become our first blogger. She established The Tribune&#8217;s beachheads on <a title="Salt Lake Tribune on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/saltlaketribune">Facebook</a> and <a title="Salt Lake Tribune on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sltrib">Twitter</a> long before each was viewed as indispensible to journalism. We had our <a title="Salt Lake Tribune on Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/sltrib/">Pinterest page</a> up while Pinterest was still in open beta.</p>
<p>More than just a social media addict, Kim truly understands the connective power of the Internet. She has been a steadfast proponent of a &#8220;persistent identity&#8221; comments format, which allows commenters to adopt pseudonyms as long as they stick with them for all comments. It&#8217;s not that radical an idea now, but it was a hard sell back in 2005. When we were getting hit with the usual comments backlash (&#8220;how can you allow such awful things on your site?&#8221;), Kim fought hard to preserve it. She argued, effectively, that the predominant culture in Utah made it trickier for individuals to attach their names to controversial positions. Now, we wouldn&#8217;t do it any other way. In 2012 our comments platform received more than one million comments from more than 42,000 separate commenters. Our site is the undisputed interactive leader among Utah news sites.</p>
<p>And Kim doesn&#8217;t just live it herself. She brings the rest of us along. Part advocate and all trainer, Kim has prodded the newsroom through emails, staff seminars and individual coaching sessions. She has used page-view data to drive discussions about what readers really want vs. what journalists think they should want. She celebrates the stories that people want to read.</p>
<p>More recently she&#8217;s taken her act on the road. She was invited to serve on a social media panel at the Associated Press Sports Editors annual meeting in Chicago last year, and she is currently running a weeklong workshop at DePauw University on all things social for journalists.</p>
<p>For Kim, it&#8217;s all about perpetual curiosity and not being encumbered by the past. She has become a crucial figure in The Salt Lake Tribune&#8217;s evolution and for that she is our nominee for the &#8220;Special Contribution&#8221; DFMie.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained why they chose McDaniel for the award:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kim&#8217;s commitment to The Salt Lake Tribune and keeping it ahead of the curve, always thinking about what&#8217;s next, deserves recognition. Her leadership to help the newsroom embrace speed and interactivity, as well as her interest in comments and reader interaction, have been significant contributions not just to the newsroom but the Salt Lake community. Her always-thinking-about-what&#8217;s-next mentality and embrace of technology is what more newsrooms need in the 21st century.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for the special contribution DFMie were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="MaryJo Webster" href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine">MaryJo Webster</a> of the Pioneer Press, who shared in the DFMies for <a title="Ben Goessling and MaryJo Webster ..." href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/pioneer-press/pioneer-press-homerun-project-wins-data-journalism-dfmie/">data journalism</a> and <a title="Pioneer Press examination ..." href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/pioneer-press-examination-public-pension-spiking-wins-investigative-journalism-dfmie/">investigative journalism</a> and was also a finalist for <a title="LA Riots Project ..." href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/los-angeles-news-group/l-a-riots-project-wins-dfmie-interactive-journalism/">interactive journalism</a>. She is the only winner of two annual DFMies and the only four-time finalist. </span></li>
<li><a title="Brian McCready" href="https://twitter.com/nhrbmccready">Brian McCready</a> of the New Haven Register, who led a makeshift bureau in a hotel in Southbury, Conn., near Newtown to lead on-site coverage of the <a title="Sandy Hook Coverage Shows Scope of Digital First Teamwork" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/02/11/sandy-hook-coverage-shows-scope-digital-teamwork/">massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px">McDaniel joined The Salt Lake Tribune in 1994 as a newsroom assistant. Good timing and a natural curiosity for technology led to writing tech stories and a prominent spot on the small development team for The Tribune&#8217;s first web site. As the internet changed and grew, she became one of the key educators in the newsroom, arming print journalists with the tools to succeed online.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px">When social media emerged, she created and managed accounts for The Tribune, while helping newsroom journalists join and master those platforms, too. Deciding content play, updating layout and design, administrating mobile sites and apps, building SEO and contextual linking, managing social media and reader comments, leading ongoing newsroom education and analyzing analytics and stats are things she touches daily as The Tribune&#8217;s digital director. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px">In the few minutes a day Kim is not online, she&#8217;s traveling with her husband, photographing wildlife, or taking care of her many pets (including Facebook star Mr Fox the Dog).</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Denver Post's YourHub community section uses its blog, The Rap Sheet, to group and display blotter items from its 10 weekly zoned editions.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/dp-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dp" /></p><p>The Denver Post&#8217;s <a href="http://yourhub.denverpost.com/denver" target="_blank">YourHub</a> community section has a great approach to grouping and displaying blotter items from its 10 zoned weekly editions.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/yhkevinh" target="_blank">Kevin Hamm</a>, a journalist for YourHub, wrote in an email to us that the blotter reports are &#8220;one of the more popular items we do, but they&#8217;re not easily read together since they&#8217;re in 10 different editions and 10 different websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I started gathering them all together, plotting them on a Google map, choosing the best dozen or so (out of 50 some-odd reports weekly), rewriting the headlines if necessary and putting them together in one post that runs on the Denver Post&#8217;s crime blog, the <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/crime/" target="_blank">Rap Sheet</a>,&#8221; Hamm wrote.</p>
<p>He adds that &#8220;it&#8217;s definitely a group effort&#8221; with the blotter for each edition written by the reporter specific to it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/TYSjo" target="_blank">interactive map</a> has been a hit, getting an average of two or three times the traffic as the full blog post.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a neat approach for both how it pulls together regional content and the added value of the map, which gives readers the ability to check out recent crimes based on their proximity to where they live or work. Plus, Kevin does a great job of pulling together the most interesting content and giving them punchy headlines.</p>
<p>Check out a recent example, &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/crime/2013/02/15/metro-denver-crime-blotter-man-waving-glow-sticks-caught-with-his-pants-down/4791/" target="_blank">Metro Denver Crime Blotter: Man waving glow sticks caught with his pants down</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>For DFM staffers looking to duplicate this effort, Kevin said he&#8217;d be happy to share more on his workflow and how to make it happen. Send him an <a href="mailto:HammK@YourHub.com"> email</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[We're collecting the best engagement projects from the month of March. Have one? Send it in!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/trentonian-bracket-bigger-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="trentonian-bracket-bigger" /></p><p>Let&#8217;s have some fun with March engagement projects.</p>
<p>My <a title="Valentine’s engagement winner: The Saratogian and The Crazy Things We Do for Love" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/digital-first-newsrooms-engage-about-valentines-day/">Valentine&#8217;s engagement contest</a> resulted in 10 great engagement ideas. I&#8217;d love to get enough ideas for March engagement to use some kind of bracket in the contest.</p>
<p>Tell me about your newsroom&#8217;s March engagement project. It can be something related to the <a title="March Madness timeline" href="http://www.ncaa.com/75th-march-madness/timeline">NCAA&#8217;s March Madness basketball tournament</a> (as the Trentonian did last year in its <a title="Trentonian’s best-bar tourney heightens March Madness engagement" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/trentonians-best-bar-tourney-heightens-march-madness-engagement/">best-bar bracket</a>, shown above). You can do something relating to the start of spring or to St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. Your project can involve engagement around the March religious holidays: Lent, Easter, Passover or another holiday that&#8217;s important in your community. Or maybe you&#8217;ll engage around something else, such as a community event.</p>
<p>What you need to do is use this <a title="March Engagement Madness form" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cftrjN78bLW9xe3YXoslI4DRqKZYcizdd1LWzN456xA/viewform">entry form</a> to tell me about your project (including a link). The engagement project doesn&#8217;t need to be finished to join the contest, but you do need to have announced it. The deadline for entries is March 11. I will launch the contest with a blog post the following day (a week before the start of the NCAA tournament). The entry form invites your suggestions for how the contest will run. I&#8217;d like to involve a bracket in some way. And I&#8217;m open to a two-phase tournament, weeding the field to some finalists (and allowing the finalists to provide updates on how their projects are going) for a second phase of voting.</p>
<p>The Valentine&#8217;s contests this year and last were limited to my blog, <a title="The Buttry Diary" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com">The Buttry Diary</a>. But we&#8217;re running this contest on both my blog and Inside Thunderdome.</p>
<p>My Valentine&#8217;s contests were open to Digital First Media newsrooms. But we&#8217;re interested in learning from successful engagement by other newsrooms, too, so I&#8217;m opening this contest to non-DFM newsrooms. Any journalistic venture can join this contest. (I may have separate brackets for DFM and non-DFM newsrooms. And be warned that DFM staffers might be disproportionately represented among readers of these blogs. So you&#8217;d better plan on some campaigning for your entry.)</p>
<p>I also welcome your suggestions for reasonable prizes for the winning newsrooms. My default prize is boxes of candy, a bigger one for the winning newsrooms and a smaller one for the runner up. The Saratogian (winner) and Reporter Herald newsrooms celebrated their Valentine&#8217;s victories:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>.@<a href="https://twitter.com/aubreecutkomp">aubreecutkomp</a> tears into our candy winnings for the <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23518love">#518love</a> contest. Thanks @<a href="https://twitter.com/stevebuttry">stevebuttry</a>! <a title="http://instagr.am/p/V62_j6pFcD/" href="http://t.co/e4ky1Fpi">instagr.am/p/V62_j6pFcD/</a></p>
<p>— Emily Donohue (@emilydonohue) <a href="https://twitter.com/emilydonohue/status/303908102992969729">February 19, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Thanks @<a href="https://twitter.com/stevebuttry">stevebuttry</a>! reward for second place winners of a <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dfm">#dfm</a> valentines contest. <a title="http://bit.ly/Y6yRIT" href="http://t.co/OgK3ltcodg">bit.ly/Y6yRIT</a><a title="http://twitter.com/JessicaBenes/status/304344250827542528/photo/1" href="http://t.co/Djf0k1PR9T">twitter.com/JessicaBenes/s…</a></p>
<p>— JessicaBenes (@JessicaBenes) <a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaBenes/status/304344250827542528">February 20, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A final point: That entry form was really easy to make using Google Forms. If you&#8217;re not using them as an engagement tool, you might consider how to use them in your engagement project. They&#8217;re simple to use. Go to <a title="Google Drive" href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> (formerly Google Docs), click &#8220;create&#8221; and choose &#8220;form&#8221; from the options. From there, the options are pretty self-explanatory. You click Send Form to get the link to share. Or you can just click &#8220;view live form&#8221; and send that link. You can view the responses by clicking &#8220;responses&#8221; (one of the options is to create a spreadsheet for your responses, which I did).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We got the scoop on a quick and effective engagement win from Jeff Payne, editor of <a href="http://voicenews.com/">The Voice</a>, a Journal Register paper in southeast Michigan.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights announced that it was filing a complaint against a few dozen high schools in the state that have Native American mascots. The Voice <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=533414073356222&amp;set=a.234171823280450.61653.109551835742450&amp;type=1">took right to its Facebook page with the news</a>, mentioning local schools targeted in the complaint and soliciting reader feedback on the issue.</p>
<p>In addition to the prompt itself being reshared 38 times, The Voice also received numerous reader responses that added to its reporting of the story. The final package was a combination of these reader comments, the Voice&#8217;s original reporting, and contributions from other DFM papers in the region &#8212; for instance, the Macomb Daily shared a response they received from one of the schools, and the Mt. Pleasant Morning Sun offered a summary of the complaint.</p>
<p>All together, it&#8217;s an example of how rapid response to a story on social media can actually help facilitate future reporting. Have you ever used Facebook to identify a source? Share your win in the comments &#8212; we&#8217;d love to hear about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/What-s-your-favorite-area-restaurant-news-herald.com_1-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="What s your favorite area restaurant    news herald.com" /></p><p>From the <a href="http://www.news-herald.com/">News-Herald</a> in Willoughby, Ohio, we have a duo of great community engagement stories. In both, the newsroom was able to reach readers where they lived. The first set of encounters was digital; the second, real-world.</p>
<p>Crafting a post just a few dozen words long, community engagement editor Cheryl Sadler didn&#8217;t have to spend a lot of time working on <a href="http://www.news-herald.com/articles/2013/02/06/life/doc51129e7e284b3543248247.txt">her prompt for readers</a>: &#8220;<em>How is the food scene in Northeast Ohio? Which area restaurant is your favorite?&#8221; </em>But the simple question inspired 76 reader comments, with suggestions ranging from Texas Roadhouse to fine Italian dining to a variety of cafes and pizza parlors.</p>
<p>Sadler came up with the idea as a way to make the News-Herald&#8217;s annual &#8220;progress&#8221; editions more accessible to readers. The News-Herald&#8217;s progress editions highlight how the community moved forward in various areas, like business, education, and healthcare, so it&#8217;s a major newsroom concern to make sure the content is reflective of readers opinions and also something they&#8217;ll actually want to read.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#8220;People actually shared their favorite restaurants,&#8221; explained Tricia Ambrose, executive editor of the paper. &#8220;Other users even came back to review and &#8216;like&#8217; those comments. We&#8217;ll have nice page of reader comments to feature when the next section comes out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sadler is already brainstorming questions to complement the remaining progress editions &#8212; from the best places to live to the best way to stay active, her questions will help fill out a more complete picture of life in northeast Ohio. And readers aren&#8217;t limited to submitting responses by website comment alone&#8230; there&#8217;s also an email dropbox that they can use and a Google Voice number for voicemails.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The second engagement success story from the News-Herald is of a kind only possible in local journalism. In combination with </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://twitter.com/NHPreps/status/301551343137611777">social media promotion of his #nhswag bag</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">, John Kampf has been visiting high school sporting events to give away T-shirts. We hear that on Wednesday night </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://twitter.com/NHPreps/status/301833396831789056">he gave away his entire stash the minute he walked in the door</a><span><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">! And sports </span>journalists<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">, take note&#8230; According to Ambrose, Kamp&#8217;s popularity on Twitter really took off this summer when he got a smartphone and began tweeting from games.</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2012/12/pearl-harbor-archives-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="The Dec. 11, 1941, Vol. 12 - No. 6 edition of Main Line Times." /></p><p>Andy Stettler, executive editor at the Main Line Times, brought to our attention a very smart community engagement tip &#8212; one uniquely fit to legacy media outlets with deep roots in their coverage areas. Like many Digital First Media publications, the Main Line Times has been in business for generations. What Stettler realized is the paper&#8217;s microfilm archives, which date back to 1930, could be used as a source of relevant and engaging content for today&#8217;s readers.</p>
<p>Leading up to the 71st anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Stettler took some time to research how the Main Line Times covered that historic event. Stettler found that the Main Line Times released its first post-Pearl Harbor edition on December 11, 1941, four days after the attack, and included stories about how the nation and the Main Line specifically were preparing for war. After converting the pages into a PDF file, he uploaded the spread to Scribd, an online document service, and embedded it into an article page.</p>
<p>He knew it was a success when he heard from relatives of someone featured in that archival edition. Stettler writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two readers contacted me after they noticed a family member of theirs was pictured on the front page of the 1941 edition. Now the daughter of the solider pictured is going to send me a story written from their research on her father. Apparently, this soldier whose last name is McIntyre was in the Pacific and in Europe. He was there for D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge.</p>
<p>Archives = Potential engagement.</p></blockquote>
