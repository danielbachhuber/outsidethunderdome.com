<p><a title="Brian Charles" href="https://twitter.com/JBrianCharles">Brian Charles</a> of the Pasadena Star-News is the Journalist of the Year for Digital First Media&#8217;s newsrooms publishing mid-sized dailies.</p>
<p>Charles is recognized for his coverage of the Pasadena police. He is one of four finalists for Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. That winner will be announced in September, when DFMie winners will be honored in Denver.</p>
<p>His editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reporter Brian Charles is a rising star in the Los Angeles News Group and DFM. His year-long coverage of the officer-involved <a title="Questions remain in the shooting of Kendrec McDade" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_22857548/one-year-later-questions-remain-shooting-death-kendrec?IADID=Search-www.pasadenastarnews.com-www.pasadenastarnews.com">shooting of an unarmed, black teenager named Kendrec McDade by Pasadena police officers</a> in pursuit of a robbery suspect uncovered <a title="More allegations come forward in Pasadena police probe" href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_22904838">questionable patterns and practices in the city&#8217;s homicide bureau</a>. It also led defense attorneys, former police officers and citizens to come forward with information that helped him to shine even more light on these patterns and practices.</p>
<p>Brian&#8217;s follow-up reporting led to the suspension of one detective and the demotion of another. More importantly, his reporting has prompted investigations by the FBI and Los Angeles County Office of Independent Review into the Pasadena Police Department and its homicide bureau. Those probes, which are continuing, already have resulted in a mistrial in a homicide case where it was discovered that two police officers intimidated a witness and hid exculpatory evidence. The Los Angeles County District Attorney&#8217;s Office is frantically examining other cases involving those two Pasadena police officers.</p>
<p>As a young father, it would have been easy for Brian to have stopped digging when he uncovered some of this information. Some segments of law enforcement turned up the heat on him to leave well enough alone. But despite that, he doggedly carried on and continued to seek the truth. His search is far from over, but already it has been noticed at the city, county, state and federal levels.</p>
<p>What makes Brian&#8217;s work even more impressive is he had much more on his plate than simply reporting on the Pasadena Police Department. As the lead writer in the Star-News&#8217; newsroom, Brian covered Pasadena City Hall and politics this past year. It was all part of his beat, one that was bigger than most in LANG. And anytime Editor Frank Girardot needed somebody to jump on a breaking news story, Brian usually got the call and eagerly gave it his all. He also was among the reporters who contributed to LANG&#8217;s Christopher Dorner coverage.</p>
<p>Brian has engaged in the sort of reporting that stands as an example to other local journalists seeking a deeper understanding of their community and its dynamics. For those reasons I believe Brian should be the Journalist of the Year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges concurred:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Charles of the Pasadena Star-News is to be commended for staying on top of the death of an unarmed man by Pasadena police officers. His stories are clear, accessible and exhaustively reported. Others have noticed: One detective was suspended, another demoted, and an investigation has been launched. His coverage and writing voice have clearly matured and he renders updates on this important story with authority and accountability. Like many reporters at a paper of this size, Brian juggles his commitment to this story among many others. His juggling act is notable and, in one of the most competitive media environments in the world, he embodies the best of local journalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Journalist of the Year in mid-sized dailies were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13.991477012634277px"><a title="J.M. Brown" href="https://twitter.com/jmbrownreports">J.M. Brown</a> of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, for a <a title="J.M. Brown project on desalination" href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/desal/ci_21646511">project on water desalination</a>.</span></li>
<li><a title="Pottstown News" href="https://twitter.com/pottstownnews">Evan Brandt</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., who was also a finalist for the <a title="Robert Mills Wins DFMie as Top Staff Blogger" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/lowell-sun/robert-mills-wins-dfmie-top-staff-blogger/">DFMie for best staff blogger</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A native New Yorker, Brian Charles graduated from the State University of New York at Purchase in 2005. He moved to California and began working in community news in 2006, starting at a rural weekly before moving to a small daily in 2008. In 2009, he was hired by the Pasadena Star-News to cover education, politics and breaking news. His work as a journalist has been recognized by the California Newspaper Publishing Association and in 2009 he won an Associated Press award for coverage of an on-campus suicide at a Los Angeles-area high school.</p>
<p>In March, Charles was promoted to a staff position the Daily Breeze, also a part of the Los Angeles News Group.</p>
<p>Charles lives in South Pasadena, with his wife, Michelle, and daughter, Natalie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="146" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/LombardoBarb-146x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Barbara Lombardo" /></p><p><a title="Barbara Lombardo" href="https://twitter.com/barb_lombardo">Barbara Lombardo</a>, editor of <a href="http://www.saratogian.com/" target="_blank">The Saratogian</a>, wins the DFMie for opinion journalism for her column and editorials about problems in the Saratoga Springs Housing Authority.</p>
<p>The nomination summed up her commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>This entry comprises <a title="Shine the light, expose the problem" href="http://saratogian.com/articles/2012/02/18/opinion/doc4f3febbdf2e46686577146.txt?viewmode=fullstory">one column</a> and <a title="Saratogian editorial" href="http://saratogian.com/articles/2012/03/11/opinion/doc4f5b8ec48b025904909547.txt">two</a> <a title="Saratogian editorial" href="http://saratogian.com/articles/2012/11/24/opinion/doc50b0ff745c26b665092699.txt?viewmode=fullstory">editorials</a> by Managing Editor Barbara Lombardo that reveal serious shortcomings with the agency that oversees federally subsidized housing in Saratoga Springs – such as pooh-poohing a bedbug infestation and grossly overpaying its director. These opinion pieces make it clear why readers should care and recommend specific courses of action. By the way, the Saratoga Springs Housing Authority took the advice in the editorial about the rolling contract, while still defending the director.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained why this entry was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>What you hear in Barbara Lombardo&#8217;s editorials is the voice of accountability, but it&#8217;s talking like a real person! People with power are held to account, and the community&#8217;s expectations are upheld. That is hardly easy to maintain in coverage of housing projects and how an oversight agency seriously bungled duties. But Lombardo&#8217;s crisp prose does a powerful job both explaining the problem and convincing the reader that reform is needed. In another writer&#8217;s hands, the agency&#8217;s mishandling of a bedbugs problem could have amounted to a joke, but Lombardo invokes accessible, relevant metaphors and packs a final punch with a great kicker. In another piece she outlines precisely what needs to be done about an overpaid director&#8217;s contract — advice, that incidentally, was followed. We see why these pieces left even the targets of her campaign convinced.</p></blockquote>

Well, how&#8217;s this for impact? Reporting by <a title="Zahira Torres" href="https://twitter.com/TxCapitolReport">Zahira Torres</a> and <a title="Hayley Kappes" href="http://www.facebook.com/hayleykappes">Hayley Kappes</a> of the El Paso Times on <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_22109113/unheeded-warnings-unheeded-warnings?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com">cheating in the El Paso School District</a> led to the state education commissioner <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_22135632/education-commissioner-removes-episd-school-board?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com">ordering the removal of the school board</a>.</p>
<p>Torres was honored last week for the yearlong project with the <a title="Zahira Torres wins Hovey-Harkness Award" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_22474174/el-paso-times-reporter-wins-national-award-episd">Hovey-Harkness Award</a> for public service reporting from Governing magazine. The DFMies are proud to pile on (and suspect we won&#8217;t be the last).</p>
<p>Editor <a title="Bob Moore" href="https://twitter.com/BobMooreNews">Bob Moore</a>&#8216;s nomination explained about the project and the December stories:</p>
<blockquote><p>A yearlong investigation by the Times has shown that the city’s largest school district has been engaged in one of the worst cheating scandals in the nation’s history. Several stories in December capped off the Times’ efforts for the year. Torres detailed how the <a title="Unheeded warnings" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_22109113/unheeded-warnings-unheeded-warnings">state education agency had been told of the cheating two years earlier</a>, but took no action. Her reporting led the education commissioner to <a title="State plans audit of TEA" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_22244498/state-plans-audit-tea">order an outside investigation</a> of how the agency missed the cheating.</p>
<p>Kappes showed that a <a title="Hughes knew about audit" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_22108164/anderson-hughes-knew-audit">former school board president was aware of an internal audit</a> that pointed to cheating, despite insistence by board members that they had never seen the audit until the Times discovered it earlier this year.</p>
<p>As a result of the Times’ yearlong investigation, the <a title="Education commissioner removes El Paso school board" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_22135632/education-commissioner-removes-episd-school-board">state education commissioner in December ordered the removal of the school board</a>, making the El Paso district the largest in Texas to ever face this sanction.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges were enthusiastic in their praise. One judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was impressed with how the reporters followed up on tips and their initial suspicions with requests for documents and thorough reporting. They exposed corruption and negligence in the school district and didn&#8217;t let readers forget what was at stake &#8212; the education of teenagers already on the verge of failing out of the system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Great work getting key interviews and documents to show that the state&#8217;s education oversight agency may have turned a blind eye to cheating problems at a local school. This is typically a very tough connection to make, but even more crucial for the public to know about than cheating at just one school. It opens a much broader discussion about whether the state agency is doing its job properly and whether it has ignored allegations of cheating in other Texas schools.<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p></blockquote>
