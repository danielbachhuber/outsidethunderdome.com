<h3><strong></strong>Beau Yarbrough</h3>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/03/october-dfmies-toutbout-embezzlement-reporting-live-sports-coverage/yarbrough/" rel="attachment wp-att-5650"><img class="alignright  wp-image-5650" alt="Yarbrough" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Yarbrough.jpg" width="355" height="590" /></a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">LANG Executive Editor Michael Anastasi explained the long background that led to Yarbrough&#8217;s </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" title="San Bernardino Sun embezzlement coverage" href="http://www.sbsun.com/topic/judith-oakes">stories about embezzlement of school lunch money</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Since he broke the story in August, Beau Yarbrough has doggedly covered allegations that a Rialto Unified School District accountant was stealing lunch money from the district&#8217;s treasury food services department.</p>
<p>Allow me to back up to February for a moment. Beau had been doing a series of hard-hitting stories on a Rialto teacher who had been caught on audio verbally abusing a student. As he reported that story, he began to receive phone calls from anonymous sources about a district accountant who&#8217;d been living a lavish lifestyle. More tips kept coming, about a possible romantic relationship with the district&#8217;s superintendent.</p>
<p>Beau smelled possibly bad stuff here, which kept him following up constantly.</p>
<p>So by August, when the accountant was actually arrested, he was ready, on it, with sources and with momentum.</p>
<p>That foundation enabled him to be several steps ahead by October, when the DA had filed their long-awaited case.</p>
<p>By then, he had numerous sources and several angles on what we knew would be not just one story but several. All we needed was the DA&#8217;s filing.</p>
<p>Sources included the private investigator, who the district commissioned to audit the finances of the district&#8217;s food services department. And it allowed Doug Saunders to cover the law enforcement angle, working his sources for important filing dates and news. Joe Nelson also worked Rialto police sources.</p>
<p>We knew to start tracking her real estate records, elements of her lifestyle, her ties to the district&#8217;s superintendent Cebrun. We got the private investigator&#8217;s report two days before everybody else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, because of this dogged beat work, October became the month for not just a story of what happened. Rather, it became a month filled with a compelling series of stories about a scandal that went way beyond a simple DA filing. These stories spanned two weeks, culminating in a one-on-one interview with a district superintendent who was forced to deny the romantic relationship, even as a Beau obtained photos that showed the two close.</p>
<p>Equally impressive is that this series of stories came in the midst of criticism that we were going after the district too hard.</p>
<p>Beau&#8217;s work proved that wrong.</p>
<p>While it was broken and covered by The Sun via dogged reporting by Beau Yarbrough, it came also with big-time contributions from reporters Doug Saunders and Joe Nelson, and across LANG from Brian Charles and Rob Kuznia, who provided investigative background and analysis on the the school district chief and on how lunch money is kept safe from the very kind of crime alleged here.</p>
<p>Digitally, we relayed the stories to online as quickly as possible, with hyperlinks included, with vigilance from our online team who socialed them out, leading to wide readership across the LANG footprint. As you&#8217;ll see, the solid journalism allowed us to present documents online for the world to see &#8212; including an alleged letter of admission, the auditor&#8217;s damning report, photo galleries, and the photos The Sun exclusively obtained of the superintendent apparently kissing the suspect.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;">Yarbrough&#8217;s reporting was what I consider to be journalism at its best. Taking a thread and pulling on it and pulling on it until the full picture is revealed. He shows a relentless drive to nail down the full story, holding those spending taxpayers&#8217; dollars accountable, and showing an awareness of every angle to be considered.</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;">Yarbrough&#8217;s advice: Make time to talk to every tipster. They, collectively, will tell you where to dig. </span></span></p>
<h3>Caroline Sweeney and Rosemarie Ross</h3>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/03/october-dfmies-toutbout-embezzlement-reporting-live-sports-coverage/concussions/" rel="attachment wp-att-5652"><img class="alignright  wp-image-5652" alt="Concussions" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Concussions.jpg" width="363" height="499" /></a>Sweeney and Ross won their DFMie for a series of stories on concussions in girls playing high school sports.</p>
<p>The opening story told of the <a title="Concussions in girls: Awareness hits home with female athletes" href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20131021/concussions-in-girls-awareness-hits-home-with-female-athletes">rising incidence of concussions in girls&#8217; sports, especially soccer</a>.</p>
<p>The second story told how <a title="Concussions in girls, part 2" href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20131021/concussions-in-girls-schools-dealing-with-reaction-to-head-injury">schools and coaches are responding to concussions and working to prevent them</a>.</p>
<p>The third story dealt with the <a title="Concussions in girls, part 3" href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20131022/concussions-in-girls-role-models-should-face-the-reality-of-head-trauma">issue of role models</a>, professional and Olympic athletes whose &#8220;toughness&#8221; after head injuries inspires younger athletes to try to continue playing when they should be seeking medical treatment.</p>
<p>In a sidebar, <a title="Fall from horse teaches reporter ..." href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20131022/fall-from-horse-teaches-reporter-the-pain-of-concussion-recovery">Sweeney told about the continuing impact she experiences from a concussion</a> suffered in a fall from a horse.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Caroline Sweeney and Rosemarie Ross did a beautiful job bringing an important issue from the shadows into the light by helping readers and community and education leaders realize that this isn’t just a problem for football players.</p>
<p>The stories were well-reported with emotional accounts from soccer players. They were partnered nicely with video interviews and twitter conversations. I especially enjoyed Caroline’s first-person account of the repercussions of her own concussion from a fall from a horse. I was equally intrigued by the effect on her daily life, as well as the difficulty in leaving behind a sport she loved.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the second DFMie for reporting about brain injuries in sports. Christopher James, then a sports writer at the Berkshire Eagle, won an <a title="Christopher James wins DFMie for sports journalism" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/spotlight/berkshire-eagle/christopher-james-wins-dfmie-sports-journalism/">annual DFMie for sports journalism</a> for a story about brain injuries.</p>

<h3>Travis Souders</h3>
<div id="attachment_5664" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/03/october-dfmies-toutbout-embezzlement-reporting-live-sports-coverage/souders-animation/" rel="attachment wp-att-5664"><img class="size-large wp-image-5664" alt="Travis Souders used iScorepad to provide real-time animation of Butte College football games." src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Souders-animation-1024x480.jpg" width="625" height="292" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Travis Souders used iScorepad to provide real-time animation of Butte College football games.</p></div>
<p>Travis Souders wins in NorCal for live sports coverage. Editor David Little explained in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Butte College near Chico is the No. 1-ranked JC team in the state, 9-0 as of this writing, yet there are no local radio broadcasts, so we get people to “tune in” to us. Using both <a title="Butte College live football coverage" href="http://live.chicoer.com/Event/Butte_College_Game_Day_Live_Week_8">ScribbleLive</a> and an iPad app that Travis found called iScorepad, we give readers live play-by-play, commentary, Tout videos, photos, a pregame interview podcast and postgame interviews. That&#8217;s a lot for one person to do — in addition to a game story and noteboook for the print edition — but Travis has excelled at this nine straight weeks.</p>
<p>We get people participating in the discussion from several other states (moms “watching” their sons from Florida and Louisiana, for example, and a dad from Sweden). It builds tremendous goodwill. We should all get this many “thank-yous” from all of our efforts.</p>
<p>Between 7,000 and 20,000 engagement minutes has been the norm each week.</p>
<p>To check out the <a title="Iscore animation" href="http://football.iscorecast.com">iScore animation</a>, enter 3B990D9E59 in the ID field at the link above and select a game (it&#8217;s better live, but you can still get the feel from a &#8220;replay&#8221;).</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Travis both moderates the Scribble Live blog and does the iScorepad gamecast at the same time, while photographer Jason Halley adds the timely photos and video. This gets promoted extensively in print before the game and on our home page during the game. The live blog is also found via search.</span></p>
<p>It really is a phenomenal live experience, as the fans prove every week by coming back.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I vote for Travis Souders because his Butte College game day live coverage combines enthusiasm for his coverage area with a thorough knowledge of his beat and his audience. The game replays with iScorepad animation are EXCELLENT and, combined with Travis&#8217;s blogging, pre- and post-game interviews and real-time photos, make for all-around very impressive coverage that&#8217;s as accessible to brand-new sports watchers as it is to veteran fans.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s inspiring to see other reporters in the company doing such good, creative, smart work!</p></blockquote>
<p>Souders provided more than a tweet&#8217;s worth of advice about live coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the work I&#8217;ve been doing with the Butte Game Day production, the one thought that stands out most:</p>
<p>I moderated and answered every Scribble and Twitter comment I could, and people came back. Engagement&#8217;s a two-way street.</p>
<p>It took quite a bit of preparation in the early going to be ready to display everything correctly, including making the graphics, uploading interviews and more. The big thing for us, at least locally, was telling people about it — we moved our preview day, where I wrote a game preview feature, to Friday instead of Saturday, for an extra 24 hours of notice, and included an in-paper box showing what I&#8217;d be doing. Of course, I shared the ScribbleLive link on my own Twitter account and the ER&#8217;s Facebook page. Example:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Butte is 15 minutes away from a home playoff game. Check it out: <a href="http://t.co/Vqww4t7Awj">http://t.co/Vqww4t7Awj</a></p>
<p>— Travis Souders (@TravisSouders) <a href="https://twitter.com/TravisSouders/statuses/401850432441425920">November 16, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>On top of that, as an &#8220;explainer,&#8221; we created a special Butte football-specific page, so that any lost or confused fans looking for the Game Day Live could have an easy directory — then, on the day of the game, I&#8217;d load a <a title="Butte College football game day live" href="http://www.chicoer.com/sports/ci_24036850/butte-college-football-game-day-live">lead story to that page</a>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Engagement is a two-way street. Happy to win for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digitalfirst&amp;src=hash">#digitalfirst</a> <a href="http://t.co/HqcRLkoLrU">http://t.co/HqcRLkoLrU</a></p>
<p>— Travis Souders (@TravisSouders) <a href="https://twitter.com/TravisSouders/statuses/407941656155938816">December 3, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the second consecutive month that live football coverage has won a DFMie. The <a title="Flood coverage results in five DFMie winners" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/11/20/flood-coverage-results-dfmie-winners/">News-Herald and Morning Journal in Ohio won for their September live coverage</a> of high school football.</p>
<h3>Bill Knight and Ruben Ramirez</h3>
<div id="attachment_5687" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/03/october-dfmies-toutbout-embezzlement-reporting-live-sports-coverage/chihuahuas/" rel="attachment wp-att-5687"><img class=" wp-image-5687 " alt="One of Ruben Ramirez's photos from the announcement of the naming of the El Paso Chihuahuas." src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Chihuahuas.jpg" width="610" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of Ruben Ramirez&#8217;s photos from the announcement of the naming of the El Paso Chihuahuas.</p></div>
<p>El Paso Times Editor Bob Moore explained the winning coverage of Knight and Ramirez in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>El Paso will get a new Triple-A baseball team and stadium in 2014, a development that has been both controversial and anticipated. The controversy and conversation reached new heights in October when the team owners, after much buildup, announced they were naming the team … the El Paso Chihuahuas.</p>
<p>The Times provided <a title="El Paso Chihuahuas live coverage" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/latestnews/ci_24355135/live-coverage-el-paso-triple-baseball-team-name">live coverage</a> of the announcement, including a ScribbleLive chat. Sportswriter <a title="El Paso baseball team named Chihuahuas" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/latestnews/ci_24363605/el-paso-triple-baseball-team-named-chihuahuas">Bill Knight’s first-day story</a> became one of the most viewed — and most commented-on — at elpasotimes.com. Photo editor <a title="Photos of El Paso Chihuahuas announcement" href="http://photos.elpasotimes.com/2013/10/22/photos-el-paso-triple-a-team-name-announcement/#1">Ruben Ramirez’s photos</a> captured the announcement well.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought the story itself was very well done with a nice package overall. The headline was great. I liked that there was video and photo to go along with the story and that I could play the video while I read the story. &#8230; And following up with the live coverage was great. People obviously had strong opinions about this decision so it was nice they had a reason to keep coming back to the story and a place to discuss it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ramirez&#8217;s advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Getting to venue an hour before announcement of baseball team name was made helped get crowd anticipation. Then moving inside for reaction.</p>
<p>Talking to crowd on hand and asking their choice made for fun comments. Then announcement made and the barking began! Chihuahuas??</p>
<p>Setting up a camera to record video and shooting photos was not as hard as it sounds, getting a good location from scouting really helped.</p>
<p>Then it was on the the team store where all those upset Fans couldn&#8217;t get enough apparel in their hands yet at first they were disappointed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lajara&#8217;s nomination explains the Freeman&#8217;s coverage of the Woodstock Film Festival:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the Daily Freeman in Kingston, N.Y. we covered the Woodstock Film Festival, using traditional reporting mixed with help with the community, tools and social media, through stories and a <a title="Woodstock Film Festival" href="http://live.dailyfreeman.com/Event/Woodstock_Film_Festival_live_coverage?Page=0">nonstop live blog</a> that took place from Oct. 2 to Oct. 6</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The festival and the Freeman (in print and online) were encouraging people to use the hashtag #wff2013 to feed our blog and our <a title="Woodstock Film Festival photo album" href="http://yourpics.dailyfreeman.com/1195721934?fb_ref=g1195721934">curated photo album</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">We <a title="Woodstock Film Festival partnership with Daily Freeman" href="http://www.woodstockfilmfestival.com/press/releases/2013_08_socialmedia.htm">partnered with the festival</a>, and on top of the partnership, we used their social media team to feed our blog.</span></p>
<p>On the side, we <a title="Zeega coverage of Woodstock Film Festival" href="http://zeega.com/156340">played with Zeega</a> and  and we <a title="Live gif of Paul Rudd" href="http://gifboom.com/x/6659a0c1">live-giffed Paul Rudd</a>.</p>
<p>Paul Rudd, Andy Garcia and Peter Bogdanovich were popular topics, as expected. And even though our home coverage was just done by Paula, Tania and Ivan, the aggregate with the community made it a 24/7 affair. The awards ceremony was live tweeted (with Glass photos! And bad lighting!) and residual traffic carried into the a couple of days after the festival was over.</p>
<p>Ivan&#8217;s wearing of Google Glass became a bit of a thing even with the people he was interviewing. It was an exhausting and rewarding process.</p>
<p>The key? Planning, an informal collaborative partnership with the festival, dedication — and a good connection and battery life.</p>
<p>We are proud that we accomplished so much with our little band of three, some creative use of tools, and collaboration.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was really impressed with the volume of work produced by a small staff. They found creative ways, by using all the tools available, to expand their coverage and create a great deal of various content for readers. To me, this type of event is absolutely perfect for something like Tout and they made great use of it by posting many videos and interviews.</p></blockquote>
<p>Freeman&#8217;s advice:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Think audience interest when writing &amp; Touting. Stay dedicated (even when exhausted). If you meet Paul Rudd, don&#39;t ask him about his genes.</p>

<p>Rosenberg wins for his tireless Twitter coverage of the Bay Area Rapid Transit strike and negotiations leading up to the strike. Randall Keith&#8217;s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our coverage of the BART strike gave Mike Rosenberg the opportunity to show his mastery of social media. Mike’s twitter feed (@RosenbergMerc) on the negotiations was must-reading for those wondering how the negotiations were going and when the trains would run again. He regularly beat all other media on the key turns in the story. Mike also gave his followers lots of wonderful bonus material; each time a BART employee spoke to the press about how management wouldn’t pay them what they were worth, Mike posted how much they really were paid (the union’s chief spokeswoman is a station agent who makes more than $100K annually).</p></blockquote>

<p>Rosenberg&#8217;s response to winning the DFMie:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve said the BART strike was a career-altering story for me from a Twitter standpoint &#8211; not only did my follower count double to more than 2,000 in the 3 months that included the two strikes but I really learned how to use Twitter beyond the whole &#8220;linking to your stories&#8221; routine. &#8230;</p>
<p>That story really did remind me of one of the main reasons why I got into this business in the first place &#8211; people really relied on us. Even though there were a lot of long days (and late nights) covering this thing, I fed off everyone&#8217;s insatiable desire for information. I knew there were a lot of desperate people out there when I&#8217;d go an hour without tweeting and people would write me asking what the latest is!</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scanning through Mike’s Twitter feed, I was able to catch up with BART negotiation issues in one location– a practice extremely useful to those who are continuously looking to social media sites for news rather than searching a news organization’s website. He also provided the public, including those affected by the halt of train operations, with valuable information immediately (i.e. BART purchasing additional cars after denying “full labor deal” linking to the announcement on BART’s web page).</p></blockquote>
<h3>Jessica Maher</h3>
<p>The Reporter-Herald&#8217;s breaking news coverage of September flooding won a DFMie. But flood coverage is a continuing story and Maher wins an October DFMie for a two-part series that told how close Loveland came to losing its water system: <a title="The 72 hours that saved Loveland's water" href="http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_24395387/72-hours-that-saved-lovelands-water">The 72 hours that saved Loveland&#8217;s water</a> and <a title="Moving the river" href="http://www.reporterherald.com/news/colorado-flood/ci_24399250/moving-river-loveland-workers-and-private-contractors-raced">Moving the river</a>.</p>
<p>Editor Jeff Stahla&#8217;s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">We had heard on the scanner during the flood bits and pieces of the drama unfolding at the treatment plant, but it was not until after the emergency was over that various sources within the city gave us access to unseen footage and interviews with the people on the ground as the Big Thompson River destroyed two of three water supply lines to the city of 70,000 and took aim at the third.</span></p>
<p>Jessica Maher used great storytelling along with visuals from Photo Editor Jenny Sparks to create a dramatic account of events in the middle of the flood.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The way she deftly frames the story and captures the drama of the situation without feeling melodramatic — while giving enough technical information to explain what happened without getting bogged down in it — kept me riveted until the end. I suspect it did for many readers, as well, which is something rare in today&#8217;s short-attention-span world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maher&#8217;s advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>A flood story doesn&#8217;t have to be about zip line rescues to show devastation and courageous work.</p>
<p>Also learned: patience. It took weeks to see the full scope but the story could reflect a complete picture.</p></blockquote>

Reporter <a title="Michael Booth" href="https://twitter.com/mboothDP">Michael Booth</a>, photojournalists <a title="Craig F. Walker" href="https://twitter.com/CraigFWalker">Craig Walker</a>, <a title="AAron Ontiveroz" href="https://twitter.com/aaronontiveroz">AAron Ontiveroz</a> and <a title="RJ Sangosti" href="https://twitter.com/RJSangosti">R.J. Sangosti</a> and artist <a title="Severiano Galvan" href="https://twitter.com/SeverianoCG">Severiano Galvan</a> win the metro DFMie for <a title="Stepping Toward Hope" href="http://www.denverpost.com/paralysis">Stepping Toward Hope</a>. The nomination from Linda Shapley explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Stepping Toward Hope&#8221; chronicled in four parts the efforts of patients suffering spinal-cord injuries to take advantage of new science and locomotor therapy that may allow them to walk again. Intense struggles, aching despair and remarkable effort are all part of their grueling stories, which were explored by health reporter Michael Booth and photographers Craig Walker, AAron Ontiveroz and R.J. Sangosti. Artist Severiano Galvan also provided graphics that helped explain what we know about paralysis and what has been learned.</p>
<p>Through compelling text, images and videos, the team was able to change what most people thought about paralysis. &#8220;Will I walk again?&#8221; has become a question that has more than one answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Booth&#8217;s explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Telling new and true stories in every possible form, that was the goal and the joy for all in this project.</p></blockquote>
<p>Walker&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>We met some wonderful people. I did 3 picture stories -so my challenge was balancing the time I spent w/ James, Mackenzie &amp; Kyle. </i></p>
<p>Another challenge was getting past the therapy and showing who these people are- despite their injuries.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The series connected me with the subjects and caused me to hurt for them and root for them.</p>
<p>But this was more than just good storytelling. It was informative. I learned about progress in spinal cord rehabilitation that I had not imagined possible. I lingered on the interactive graphics. I was reminded of what I already knew the spine and learned what I had not known about the spine and the effects of injuries to it.</p>
<p>The videos put me in the room with the subjects as they pushed through their therapy. It was excruciating to watch.</p></blockquote>
<h3>News-Herald and Morning Journal</h3>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/12/03/october-dfmies-toutbout-embezzlement-reporting-live-sports-coverage/election-profiles/" rel="attachment wp-att-5689"><img class="alignright  wp-image-5689" alt="Election profiles" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Election-profiles.jpg" width="365" height="524" /></a>Voters in DFM communities in Ohio got plenty of information about local races to help them make their choices in November&#8217;s elections.</p>
<p>The nomination from Editor Tricia Ambrose explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>In September, we hosted three open houses (two at the News-Herald, one at the Morning Journal) inviting candidates to come and meet staffers, get a photo taken, record a video, return the completed questionnaire we had mailed them and get information on advertising options.</p>
<p>We then created candidate profiles for the 307 local candidates who returned the questionnaires. Profiles were gathered on a <a title="Election profiles" href="http://electionprofiles.blogspot.com/">blog</a> (which has garnered 10,000 views) and each featured a brief intro to the candidate, the candidate’s photo, 45-second video pitch, actual questionnaire uploaded to Scribd and link to the staff-written race preview story. Then we linked from their name in the preview story to that bio.</p>
<p>Each of those stories was then posted in a <a title="Geauga County November 2013 election preview" href="http://northernohiolocalpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/09/geauga-county-november-2013-election.html">county-specific blog post</a> that was posted as a Hot Topic on the news and opinion pages.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am sure your readers are very interested in local elections and the candidates and this coverage is important to them. &#8230; I liked how the county candidates and issues were listed and the reader could simply click on their township to find their candidates and issues that will effect them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Advice from News-Herald editors:</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">From Engagement Editor Cheryl Sadler:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Develop a plan for how the content will be published so the candidates understand how it will be used.</p>
<p>Involve as much of your staff as possible in implementation, so one staffer doesn&#8217;t get bogged down.</p>
<p>Make sure profiles are published, linked to preview stories ASAP. Don&#8217;t keep candidates or voters waiting.</p></blockquote>
<p>From Editor Tricia Ambrose:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be sure to set deadline for candidates to return info &amp; don&#8217;t allow resubmissions.</p>
<p>Have plenty of staff at open houses so there&#8217;s no logjam of folks awaiting photo, video or ad info.</p></blockquote>
<h3>ToutBout winner Roger Aylworth</h3>
<p><a title="Roger Aylworth" href="https://twitter.com/RogerAylworth">Aylworth</a> wins for the video shot in the Tout app for his shot of a rough road. Here&#8217;s what a judge said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good use of Tout to illustrate how bad this road really is to drive. The video with its first-person view gives the watcher a front seat to how rough this road is to travel over.</p></blockquote>

<h3>ToutBout winner Laura Oda</h3>
<p><a title="Laura Oda" href="https://twitter.com/lodafoto">Oda</a> wins for the best video shot and edited outside the app and imported into Tout. &#8220;I got all choked up watching it,&#8221; a judge said.</p>

(Photo By Craig F. Walker / The Denver Post)" /></p><p>Flood coverage dominated the September DFMies, with five newsrooms winning awards for their coverage of local disasters.</p>
<p>For the first time the September DFMies had a separate class for the metro newsrooms of Digital First Media. The <a title="Denver Post photographers ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/denver-post-photographers-hiked-biked-and-waded-to-shoot-floods/">Denver Post photo staff</a> won the first Metro DFMie for its coverage of the Colorado floods. Post photojournalists discuss their work in one of the videos below.</p>
<p>Three other Colorado newsrooms — the <a title="Daily Camera staff worked round the clock ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/daily-camera-staff-worked-round-the-clock-in-flood-coverage/">Daily Camera</a> in Boulder, <a title="Times-Call covered nothing but flooding ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/times-call-covered-nothing-but-flooding-for-a-week/">Times-Call</a> in Longmont and <a title="Reporter-Herald covered breaking flood news relentlessly ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/reporter-herald-covered-breaking-flood-news-relentlessly-then-stepped-back-for-a-broader-look/">Reporter-Herald</a> in Loveland — won DFMies in the Colorado/Utah cluster. In the initial judging, the three newsrooms each won a vote from the three judges considering the cluster&#8217;s finalists. In previous DFMies, we&#8217;ve asked another judge to break ties, but <a href="http://twitter.com/jimbradysp" target="_blank">Jim Brady</a> and I decided the extraordinary circumstances and outstanding coverage warranted giving full awards to each newsroom.</p>
<p>The same weather system brought flooding in New Mexico, too, and the Carlsbad Current-Argus staff won the DFMie for the Texas/New Mexico cluster for its flood coverage. (See the video below about the Current-Argus coverage.)</p>
<p>In another first, the <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/tag/tout-bout/" target="_blank">ToutBout</a> awards have been combined with the DFMies. The ToutBout winners are Frankie Frost of the Marin Independent Journal and Anda Chu of the Bay Area News Group.</p>
<p><strong>Local watchdog reporting produced two DFMies for September:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Michael Price and Kristina Scala explain ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/michael-price-and-kristina-scala-explain-their-reporting-on-racist-text-messages/">Michael Price and Kristina Scala</a> of the <a href="http://www.dailylocal.com" target="_blank">Daily Local News</a> in West Chester, Pa., won in the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster for breaking and repeatedly advancing the story of Coatesville school officials exchanging racist text messages.</li>
<li><a title="Sandy Mazza explains ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/sandy-mazza-explains-her-dfmie-winning-stories/">Sandy Mazza</a> of the <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com" target="_blank">Daily Breeze</a> in Torrance, Calif., won the Los Angeles News Group DFMie for reporting that forced the resignation of the Carson city manager who was hired despite lacking qualifications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sports coverage was also big in the September DFMies, producing three awards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Julia Prodis Sulek and Darry Matsuda won the DFMie for the Bay Area News Group for their coverage of the America&#8217;s Cup. (See their video below and their <a title="Julia Prodis Sulek and Darryl Matsuda discuss ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/julia-prodis-sulek-and-darryl-matsuda-discuss-americas-cup-coverage/">tweets about their winning effort</a>.)</li>
<li><a title="'Friday Night Live' ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/friday-night-live-football-coverage-won-dfmie-for-ohio-sports-staffs/">Cheryl Sadler and the sports staffs</a> of the <a href="http://www.news-herald.com" target="_blank">News-Herald</a> in Willoughby, Ohio, and the <a href="http://www.morningjournal.com" target="_blank">Morning Journal</a> in Lorain, Ohio, won the DFMie for the Midwest cluster for their Friday night live chats reporting on area high school football.</li>
<li><a title="Relationships benefit Laura Amato's high school football coverage" href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/relationships-benefit-laura-amatos-high-school-sports-coverage/">Laura Amato</a> of <a href="http://www.troyrecord.com" target="_blank">The Record</a> in Troy, N.Y., won for her multi-platform coverage of high school football.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Nels Johnson explains ..." href="http://dfmies.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/nels-johnson-explains-project-on-fallen-firefighters/">Nels Johnson</a> gave the <a href="http://www.marinij.com" target="_blank">Marin Independent Journal</a> two winners for the month, taking the DFMie for the Northern California cluster for his story about Marin County firefighters who have died in the line of duty.</p>
<p><strong>Tout Bout awards<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Frost won his ToutBout for the best video shot in the Tout app, capturing a spontaneous song led by local musician before a meeting to discuss a controversial issue in Marin County, plans to build affordable, high-density housing:</span></p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/b8cd54" height="400" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

This allows for some creative styling and advanced editing that just isn’t as easy on a mobile phone. Meeks, from the Long Beach Press-Telegram, earned 57 percent of the vote with her coverage of Boeing&#8217;s C-17 take-off from Long Beach airport.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-150x150.gif" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tout Bout Logo" /></p><p><img class="alignright  wp-image-3395" alt="Tout Bout Logo" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout.gif" width="180" height="181" /></p>
<p>Thanks to the dozens of Digital First Media journalists who <a title="Enter now for the September Tout Bout" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/09/september-tout-bout/" target="_blank">submitted an entry in this month&#8217;s Tout Bout</a>. Our panel has watched them all and selected a new batch of finalists for you to vote on below.</p>
<p>Remember, there are two categories – videos shot with the Tout mobile app and videos that were not shot on mobile, but were distributed with Tout. The finalists for each category were selected based on news value, production quality and, most importantly, creativity. Now it’s up to you to decide which Tout deserves the $200 and $100 prize, respectively. Review the finalist videos below, cast your vote at the bottom, and share your vote with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23toutbout" target="_blank">#ToutBout</a>. The voting deadline is Mon., Sept. 30.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATED 9/30</strong>: Voting is now closed. The winners will be announced this week on Inside Thunderdome.</em></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> After this month&#8217;s Bout, the competition will be held quarterly, rather than monthly. More details to come after we declare this month&#8217;s winners, so stay tuned here at Inside Thunderdome.</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE CATEGORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://twitter.com/cmijs" target="_blank">Catherine Bowen Mijs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrosenbaum" target="_blank">Joel Rosenbaum</a> and <a href="mailto: gtrott@thereporter.com" target="_blank">Greg Trott</a>, The Reporter</strong><br />
&#8220;This Tout from the scene of a 7-alarm fire that destroyed several homes and burned 40 acres in Fairfield on Aug. 27, along with Touts by staff photographers Joel Rosenbaum and Greg Trott, helped us to tell the story in a way that words and still photos just couldn&#8217;t. As we posted each breaking Tout, more and more people began to contact us including all the Bay Area television stations that wanted our footage!&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinMiller1883" target="_blank">Robin Miller</a></p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="https://twitter.com/anchoratfreeman" target="_blank">Paula Mitchell, Daily Freeman<br />
</a></strong>&#8220;This Tout submission includes <a href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2013/08/31/blotter/doc522099e9d5459169277550.txt?viewmode=fullstory" target="_blank">four videos as a package</a> on a tragedy in a small town. Two teens were killed and two others injured in a car accident a week before school began. The boys were on the football team and on their way to a practice. I&#8217;m submitting the package because they appeared on our website long before the story did and covered all angles of the accident from eyewitnesses to school officials. The Daily Freeman had the story long before any other media outlet, and the Touts were the tools we used to get the details out to our readers. The videos were well-viewed, getting thousands of hits as a package. They were shot on location and edited on my iPhone (in my car).&#8221; &#8211; Paula Mitchell</p>

</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#8220;Shows high school game action of an athletic catch by player. The shooter didn&#8217;t flinch and move away from the action and captures the play long enough for us to catch the receiver diving into the end zone after catching a ball while being tightly defended.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertMeeksPT" target="_blank">Robert Meeks</a></span></p>

<p><strong>NON-MOBILE CATEGORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://twitter.com/cineclark" target="_blank">Clark Coleman, Monterey Herald</a><br />
</strong>&#8220;I am nominating this Tout because it was filmed and edited to tell a cohesive story in 45 seconds. It was used in conjunction with a features story to tease a local film festival. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This Tout stands out among other Touts because more attention was put into the production value.&#8221; &#8211; Clark Coleman</span></p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="https://twitter.com/KarenMeeksPT" target="_blank">Karen Robes Meeks, Long Beach Press-Telegram</a><br />
</strong>&#8220;Boeing Co. senior manager Dave Marendino has worked on the C-17 program since the first military plane took off from its East Long Beach ramp more than 20 years ago. Like many longtime employees, Marendino takes pride in delivering the plane for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions. The recent delivery of the final C-17 to the U.S. Air Force was emotional for many, so Marendino&#8217;s farewell to the plane as it leaves Long Beach for Charleston, S.C. was a bittersweet moment I wanted to capture. Special thanks to Robert Meeks for his help on this video.&#8221; &#8211; Karen Robes Meeks</p>

It&#8217;s a new month, which means it&#8217;s time for a new round of Tout Bout. This is where Digital First journalists get a chance to win some money for their best video work.</p>
<p>Last month, <a title="Lauren Boyer and Devon Turchan win August Tout Bout" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/03/august-tout-bout-winners/" target="_blank">Lauren Boyer and Devon Turchan</a> were crowned the August victors by readers here on Inside Thunderdome in their respective categories.

<p><b>The prizes: </b>There are two categories. $200 will be awarded to the best Tout filmed and edited on a mobile device. $150 will be awarded to the best video that was distributed through Tout, but filmed and/or edited with more than just a mobile device.</p>

<p><b>Then what? </b>An unbiased group of judges will narrow the nomination to 10 finalists, which will be announced on <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/">Inside Thunderdome</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dfmthunderdome">Twitter</a> on September 23. The two winners will be determined by a popular vote. If you are a finalist, we will notify you via email so you can  engage your network in the office and on social media to vote for you.</p>
<p><b>Important dates: </b>Nominations close for this month’s contest at 5 p.m. ET on <strong>Sept. 18</strong>. The finalists will be announced on <strong>Sept. 23</strong> and voting for the finalists will be open from <strong>Sept. 23 &#8211; 27</strong>.

Congratulations to <strong>Lauren Boyer</strong> and <strong>Devon Turchan</strong>, whose videos were voted as the best of Digital First Media for the month of August.</p>
<p>Lauren Boyer, a reporter at the York Daily Record in York, Pa., wins the $200 monthly prize for the best Tout shot on a mobile device.  She beat out five other finalists in the mobile category with the tongue-in-cheek <a href="http://www.tout.com/m/erqush">&#8220;Santander&#8221;</a> taking 37 percent of the vote. Coming in second was <a href="http://www.tout.com/m/gox9f3">&#8220;Zimmerman Protests&#8221;</a>, a series of Touts by Natalie Alund of the Bay Area News Group and Almendra Carpizo of the Chico Enterprise Record came in third with &#8221;<a href="http://www.tout.com/m/tolqc3">Plane Crash</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Check out &#8220;Santander&#8221;:<br />

<p><a href="http://www.tout.com/m/xqib8r">Devon Turchan&#8217;s &#8220;Shaving Cream Showdown&#8221;</a> won DFM&#8217;s first $100 award <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/08/02/august-tout-bout-rules-prizes/">created especially for fantastic Tout videos that were not shot and edited on mobile devices</a>. This allows for some creative styling and advanced editing that just isn&#8217;t as easy on a mobile phone. Turchan, a reporter at The News-Herald in Willoughby, Ohio, showcased some of that editing in this fast-paced and fun video that won this category with 34 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Jason Halley, of the Chico Enterprise Record, was a close second with <a href="http://www.tout.com/m/mdi13t">&#8220;Roadwork&#8221;</a> and Sonya Paclob of the York Daily Record came in third with &#8220;<a href="http://www.tout.com/m/wf52u9">Raw Photos</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/08/27/august-tout-bout-finalists/">all of the finalists</a>!</p>
