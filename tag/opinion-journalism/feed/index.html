				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Rick-Mills2-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Rick Mills2" /></p><p><strong>Rick Mills</strong>, editor of the Morning Sun in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., won the <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank">2014 Opinion Journalism DFMie</a> for his columns challenging court secrecy.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unusual secrecy surrounding a local murder prompted Rick Mills to investigate further and find that the Clare County District Court was ignoring court rules and state Supreme Court guidelines in keeping key documents &#8212; affidavits on the evidence leading to arrests &#8212; hidden. This case remains troubling. A year later, the defendant has still not faced trial, and the lead investigator just resigned from the Clare County Sheriff&#8217;s Department. Something remains amiss.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nomination included two links:</p>
<p><a title="Clare court ignores rules, keeps key murder file secret" href="http://www.themorningsun.com/article/20130412/OPINION03/130419890">Clare court ignores rules, keeps key murder file secret</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" title="Clare courts follow the rules, seal documents" href="http://www.themorningsun.com/article/20130420/OPINION03/130429955">Clare courts follow the rules, seal documents</a></span></p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rick Mills is the best kind of columnist: not only an opinion writer, but a reporter. His detailed account of his efforts to obtain an affidavit in a murder case &#8212; a document that should have been public &#8212; takes the reader along as he faces one arrogant and incompetent authority after the other. In the end, he teaches some of these officials the fundamentals of the law, and shows the reader how basic civil rights can hang on the whim of a supposed public servant.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="146" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/LombardoBarb-146x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Barbara Lombardo" /></p><p><a title="Barbara Lombardo" href="https://twitter.com/barb_lombardo">Barbara Lombardo</a>, editor of <a href="http://www.saratogian.com/" target="_blank">The Saratogian</a>, wins the DFMie for opinion journalism for her column and editorials about problems in the Saratoga Springs Housing Authority.</p>
<p>The nomination summed up her commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>This entry comprises <a title="Shine the light, expose the problem" href="http://saratogian.com/articles/2012/02/18/opinion/doc4f3febbdf2e46686577146.txt?viewmode=fullstory">one column</a> and <a title="Saratogian editorial" href="http://saratogian.com/articles/2012/03/11/opinion/doc4f5b8ec48b025904909547.txt">two</a> <a title="Saratogian editorial" href="http://saratogian.com/articles/2012/11/24/opinion/doc50b0ff745c26b665092699.txt?viewmode=fullstory">editorials</a> by Managing Editor Barbara Lombardo that reveal serious shortcomings with the agency that oversees federally subsidized housing in Saratoga Springs – such as pooh-poohing a bedbug infestation and grossly overpaying its director. These opinion pieces make it clear why readers should care and recommend specific courses of action. By the way, the Saratoga Springs Housing Authority took the advice in the editorial about the rolling contract, while still defending the director.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained why this entry was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>What you hear in Barbara Lombardo&#8217;s editorials is the voice of accountability, but it&#8217;s talking like a real person! People with power are held to account, and the community&#8217;s expectations are upheld. That is hardly easy to maintain in coverage of housing projects and how an oversight agency seriously bungled duties. But Lombardo&#8217;s crisp prose does a powerful job both explaining the problem and convincing the reader that reform is needed. In another writer&#8217;s hands, the agency&#8217;s mishandling of a bedbugs problem could have amounted to a joke, but Lombardo invokes accessible, relevant metaphors and packs a final punch with a great kicker. In another piece she outlines precisely what needs to be done about an overpaid director&#8217;s contract — advice, that incidentally, was followed. We see why these pieces left even the targets of her campaign convinced.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other opinion finalists were:</p>

<p><em><em>A committee of Digital First Media journalists has discussed how journalists should share personal opinions extensively, aided by Advisory Board member <a title="Jay Rosen" href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu">Jay Rosen</a>, who has written frequently about the &#8220;<a title="The view from nowhere: Questions and answers" href="http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">view from nowhere</a>.&#8221; The group recommends these guidelines to help DFM journalists and newsroom leaders in deciding whether, when and how staff members should express, or refrain from expressing, personal opinions.</em></em></p>
<p><em>This is the second in <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2012/12/14/opinion-engagement-social-media/">a series of posts</a> sharing the group&#8217;s advice to Digital First newsrooms, opinion pages and individual journalists. The group members are listed at the end of this post. </em></p>
<h3>Guiding values</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Journalists and newsrooms should seek truth and report it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Opinions are an important part of the journalism we provide for our community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">We must always seek to build trust.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Transparency helps build trust.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Journalists should avoid or disclose conflicts that may shape their reporting or opinions.</p>
<h3>Recommendations<b> </b></h3>
<p>Journalists should avoid statements of advocacy in all platforms except editorials and specifically labeled opinion content. However, advocacy is not the only type of opinion content.</p>
<p>With their editors’ approval and guidance, journalists who are sufficiently knowledgeable about topics should write with authority, which can include analysis, commentary and calling out false statements by politicians and other newsmakers. Journalists who may write with authority should do so in social media and broadcast appearances as well as on our company’s own platforms. Editors should consider whether such content should be labeled in some way to distinguish it from traditional neutral reporting.</p>
<p>A journalist may gain the ability to write with authority as he or she gains experience in the community or on a beat or a particular topic. Or a journalist with authority on a topic might start covering a different topic where he or she is less authoritative. Either the editor or the journalist should initiate discussions about whether the journalist’s level of authority has changed.</p>
<p>Our highest value as journalists and news organizations is to seek truth and report it. This means going beyond the faux balance of <a title="He-said-she-said" href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2009/04/12/hesaid_shesaid.html">he-said-she-said</a> stories to learn, document and state what is true. Once our reporting has established the truth of a situation, future reporting should repeat that truth, especially if newsmakers continue to repeat statements that have been documented as false.</p>
<p>For some staff members and some beats, editors may say journalists should refrain entirely from statements of opinion, either because the topic is so polarizing, because opinions in that area might jeopardize credibility or because the journalist is not ready to write with authority on that topic.</p>
<p>We generally encourage journalists to join debates within our profession on matters such as journalism ethics, innovation and whether and when journalists should express opinions. Statements of advocacy are acceptable in these professional discussions.</p>
<p>For most journalists covering news beats or editing general news, statements of opinion in social media and other platforms about matters of culture such as entertainment or sports are acceptable. Journalists covering those areas should discuss with their editors what level of opinion is acceptable. Conversely, journalists covering areas such as entertainment or sports might be freer than news reporters to express views on politics or local news. All journalists interested in expressing opinions in areas they don’t normally cover should discuss with their editors what is acceptable and what might be troublesome. Part of this discussion should be whether the journalist might cover the topics someday and whether these statements of opinion would jeopardize credibility.</p>
<p>Staff members should always disclose to editors when they have personal involvements or experience that might color their reporting or support a perception of bias. Editors and staff members should discuss whether such potential conflicts are serious enough to warrant reassignment. Where the conflicts are not significant enough to merit reassignment, editors should disclose the journalist’s involvement or experience to readers. Possible ways of disclosure might include an editor’s note or a first-person sidebar.</p>
<p>For staff members who regularly express opinions, we should consider a standing disclosure of experiences and relationships that may influence their views, such as <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/about/disclosures-about-steve-buttry/">Steve Buttry’s disclosure on his blog</a> (which is more detailed than some journalists might need). This disclosure should be linked from the “about” page on a journalist’s blog.</p>
<p>DFM journalists should consider first-person writing in appropriate situations. If a journalist’s personal experience or perspective on a story would add to the reader’s understanding, journalists and/or their editors should suggest such an approach, possibly as a sidebar, a first-person main story, an accompanying video or blog post.</p>
<p>Staff members can and should be <a title="Journalists should be personable but professional in social media" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/journalists-should-be-personable-but-professional-in-social-media-use/">personable in social media</a>, live chats and blogs regardless of what level of opinion is acceptable for them.</p>
<p>When journalists’ work prompts statements of from the public, such as in story comments or on social media, the journalists should engage in the discussion. If it would be inappropriate for the journalist to express opinions, it is still fine to respond in other ways, such as thanking readers for their comments or correcting opinion misstatements of fact.</p>
<p>We encourage discussions between staff members and their editors about when, whether and how journalists should produce commentary, write with authority or otherwise express opinions. One policy does not fit all DFM journalists or fit a particular journalist in every situation.</p>
<p>We encourage training and coaching on such matters as writing with authority, fact-checking and appropriate forms of opinion journalism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2012/12/Bagley-Cartoons-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="As the Salt Lake Tribune demonstrates, Pinterest is just one of several social media platforms that are being used to enhance and extend engagement in opinion journalism." /></p><p><em>A group of Digital First Media journalists have been discussing several aspects of opinion journalism this year. This is the first in a series of posts sharing the group&#8217;s advice to Digital First newsrooms, opinion pages and individual journalists. The group members are listed at the end of this post. </em></p>
<p>Opinions are an important and vibrant part of social media, and DFM opinion journalism efforts need to make effective and extensive use of social media. To guide these efforts, we present a few general principles and some specific recommendations:</p>
<h3>Principles</h3>
<p>Social media are as important a platform for opinion journalism as print editorial pages and opinion sections of news websites and apps.</p>
<p>Social media conversation should both precede and follow publication of editorials.</p>
<p>Columnists, bloggers, cartoonists and other staff members producing personal opinion journalism should use social media effectively.</p>
<p>We can and should use social media to drive traffic to opinion content on our websites and apps, but we should use social media at least as much for conversation.</p>
<p>We should join conversations in social media, as well as seeking to lead and host conversations.</p>
<p>We should respect all opinions that are expressed respectfully. We should model civility in community conversation. We should firmly but civilly reject hateful expressions of opinion in all contexts, even when we agree with the underlying opinions.</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>At this point, <a title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> appear to be the most effective social networks for opinion journalism. But we certainly should explore the use of other social tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="YouTube" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> may be a good tool for soliciting and sharing staff and community opinion videos.</li>
<li>We should post opinion content on <a title="Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> for its search value (and engage in conversations if any develop there). G+ also might be useful for opinion-related Hangouts (possibly livestreamed and embedded on our sites using YouTube).</li>
<li><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> might be an effective way to distribute <a title="Bagley Cartoons Pinboard" href="http://pinterest.com/sltrib/bagley-cartoons/">editorial cartoons</a> and other visual opinion content.</li>
<li>Opinion journalists should experiment with new social tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>DFM editorial boards should seek input on social media before writing editorials and use social media to start conversations after publication of editorials. Here’s a sample scenario for such conversation:</p>
<p>Your community is having a bond-issue election for the construction of a new high school. About a week before the editorial board is going to consider its position on the matter, you solicit community opinions through social media in a variety of ways.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1<sup>st</sup>  tweet:</strong> Planning editorial soon: Should DFMtown borrow $12 million to build a new high school south of town? Why or why not? #dfmbonds</p>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> tweet, linking to best news story:</strong> Background on DFMtown high-school bond issue: bit.ly/123dfm Should editorial support or oppose? #dfmbonds</p></blockquote>
<p>The Facebook update (and Google+ post): We’re going to be writing an editorial soon on the Nov. 6 bond election for a new high high school south of DFMtown. How do you plan to vote and why? The $12 million in bonds would raise the property taxes by $100 a year for the owner of a home valued at $100,000. Supporters say the old school is unsafe, overcrowded and outdated. Opponents say the tax-increase is too steep. What do you think? bit.ly/123dfm</p>
<p>(Rather than posting as an update, you might post an image, such as a photo of the current school, artist’s rendering of the new school or map showing the new school’s location. Images generate stronger engagement than updates, so use that approach if you have a good image to use.)</p>
<p>On the website and in the newspaper, you might publish a similar solicitation, curating some of the responses from social media.</p>
<p>When you publish the editorial, you might accompany it in print and/or online with a curation of the social media responses. You seek to continue the conversation on both platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tweet:</strong> Our view: New $12 million high school is an important investment in DFMtown’s youth: bit.ly/123dfm  What’s your view?</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> We say: DFMtown needs a new high school to replace a building that’s unsafe for students and not equipped for 21<sup>st</sup>-century. The portable classes used to relieve crowding at the current school are not a suitable environment for education. If DFMtown is going to grow and attract families and industry, voters need to approve this reasonable investment. bit.ly/123dfm LIKE this if you agree with our editorial. If you disagree, tell us in the comments why you’re voting against the bond issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, if you generate a good discussion, you should curate the responses from Twitter and/or Facebook for the website and/or op-ed page.</p>
<p>On YouTube and your website, you post a video editorial. You invite video responses and post those on your site.</p>
<p>If community interest in the bond issue is especially intense, you might host a live chat on Twitter (remember to use a hashtag such as #dfmschoolchat) or Facebook (or <a title="ScribbleLive" href="http://scribblelive.com">ScribbleLive</a>). You can host the chat and just discuss with the community. Or you can interview a guest (or people on opposing sides of an issue), inviting the public to join the discussion.</p>
<p>Another option would be a live video chat. You could Hangout with leaders of campaigns for and against the bond issue (and invite members of the public who want to join as well to ask questions). You use YouTube to livestream the conversation and embed it on your site.</p>
<p>When a news event provokes strong response, you won’t have time to seek opinions before writing a quick editorial. But you could curate social media opinions to accompany the editorial and invite people to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Opinion editors also should watch for good opportunities to use tools such as <a title="Storify" href="http://storify.com">Storify</a> or <a title="Reddit" href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> to curate opinion content on community topics. A Reddit <a title="Reddit Ask Me Anything" href="http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/iama">AMA (Ask Me Anything)</a> might be a way to host a live chat if Reddit engagement is strong in your community.</p>
<p>Obviously DFM staffs dedicate different levels of resources to opinion journalism, and the resources available will affect how much time we can use in opinion engagement using social media. A newsroom with an opinion editor and some editorial writers and columnists can and should engage more deeply on social media. A top editor who writes editorials and a personal column and blog in addition to running the newsroom cannot be expected to execute the engagement described above for every editorial. But even that editor should use at least a scaled-down version of the scenario above for big community issues.</p>
<p>As newsrooms designate <a title="Engagement editors: an engaging, important job" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/engagement-editors-an-emerging-important-job-in-digital-first-newsrooms/">engagement editors</a> or social media editors, we should recognize that they can increase our staff resources for opinion engagement, even in small newsrooms. Opinion engagement should be a significant duty of the engagement editor, so that editor might handle the social media conversation (either sharing the public input with the editor or writing an occasional editorial). <a title="Curation techniques, tips and types" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/curation-techniques-types-and-tips/">Curation</a> of opinion content should certainly be a duty of engagement editors.</p>
<p>If an opinion staff is large enough to provide sufficient social engagement (as the <a title="Denver Post Opinion Facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverPostOpinion?fref=ts">Denver Post</a> does), we recommend creating separate social media accounts or pages for opinion engagement. The experience, content and conversation are different enough from news content that they can generate a strong, focused engagement opportunity (with occasional retweeting or cross-sharing to the main branded account). For smaller staffs that would not be able to generate as much opinion engagement, the practices recommended here should work well from main newsroom accounts.</p>
<p>Please note that all of these recommendations are not focused on driving traffic but driving engagement. They will drive significant traffic (note how often the guidelines suggest including a link to a story or editorial or creating content from social media for the website, whether it’s an embed or a curation). If we follow these suggestions, we will make meaningful contributions to the discussion of community issues as well as driving traffic to our sites.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of the opinion group, I will develop a webinar (or series of webinars) to train DFM journalists in these uses of social media for opinion engagement in the coming year.</p>
