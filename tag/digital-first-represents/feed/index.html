				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the third in a series of reports from three Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR14 through the <a title="And the #NICAR14 Digital First Represents winners are …" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/12/20/nicar14-digital-represents-winners-are/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents program</a>.</em></p>
<p>Late last year, a worker at York Hospital (in Pennsylvania) erroneously injected a patient with radioactive white blood cells, a pharmaceutical designed to detect infections.</p>
<p>Aside from some minor swelling, the patient showed no ill effects. The patient received the same level of radiation a person receives in a year from the natural environment.</p>
<p>Much of my <a href="http://www.ydr.com/business/ci_24891937/" target="_blank">reporting</a> for that story came from data that I pulled from U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>At the time, I was not aware of the Association of Health Care Journalists&#8217; <a href="http://www.hospitalinspections.org/" target="_blank">website</a> — a repository of hospital reviews sorted by area.</p>
<h1>Data improves health coverage</h1>
<p>During his turn at the NICAR 2014 microphone, <a href="https://twitter.com/byPeterEisler" target="_blank">Peter Eisler</a> of USA Today took those who attended the &#8220;Wading through the sea of data of hospitals, doctors, medicine and more&#8221; session on a tour of this website and that of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>Using tips passed along by Eisler, I learned that officials had uncovered a medical screening exam violation at a local hospital — data that could lead to a follow-up to my original story.</p>
<p>Both Eisler and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/dan-keating/2012/09/27/8207c022-08ca-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_page.html" target="_blank">Dan Keating</a> of The Washington Post explained ways to download the <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare" target="_blank">physician compare database.</a></p>
<p>For example, with the help of ArcView and U.S. Census data shape files, I can map doctors by their age, specialty and school in which they graduated. Taking income data, I can layer the map to show where younger/older doctors practice. Such a map could also do the same for specialities.</p>
<p>Do plastic surgeons practice in more affluent areas of the York County area? What sections of York County are home to the fewest doctors?</p>
<h1>Data improves public housing coverage</h1>
<p>Mapping, as I learned in mini boot camp at NICAR, can and should be applied to multiple topics.</p>
<p>Tim Henderson pointed out in his <a href="http://slid.es/timhenderson/section8">session</a> — &#8221;How to uncover inequity and swindlers in subsidized housing programs near you&#8221; — that maps would be the ideal way to show the disbursement of the public housing across an area.</p>
<p>After haggling with HUD for Section 8 housing data, Henderson said he was able not only to produce a map of public housing, but he also painted a clear picture of an economically distressed area.</p>
<p>He was able to use census data to gauge minority population and rental percentages to peer into the the availability of the affordable housing in a given area.</p>
<p>What Henderson found was that areas with little or no Section 8 housing and few rentals may discourage affordable housing. Also, he recommended looking at minority census tracts and mapping the affordable housing options.</p>
<h1>Data improves education coverage</h1>
<p>Full disclosure: I&#8217;m not an education writer. Sure, I&#8217;ve covered school-related stories as they&#8217;ve crossed into my beat, but my focus has never been standardized tests or the mapping of school bus routes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s going to change.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/coulterjones" target="_blank">Coulter Jones</a> of WNYC New York Public Radio pointed out some great ideas for education-related stories that I plan to report.</p>
<p>For example, during his session, Jones suggested that journalists request attendance records. This data may be used to check fire alarm/student ratios and which schools have the worst problems with attendance.</p>
<p>He urged us to request the records of school bus drivers, such as accident reports and criminal histories.</p>
<p>Another good suggestion was to overlay health inspection data with school attendance to see if students are getting sick after a failed inspection.</p>
<p><em>Why stop there? That&#8217;s just a look at how data can improve Sean&#8217;s beat coverage. Check out Chrys Wu&#8217;s compendium of <a href="http://blog.chryswu.com/2014/02/21/nicar14-slides-tutorials-links-tools/" target="_blank">slides and handouts from NICAR</a> to see how data can help upgrade your beat.  </em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[At NICAR, Lindsey Anderson learned that data is much more than official statistics. Here are some tips and examples to help you DIY (Do It Yourself).]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/180407759-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="(Photo by ThinkStock)" /></p><p>Before I went to the annual <a title="DFM at #NICAR14" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/live/dfm-nicar14/">NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting)</a> conference, I often thought of data as numbers gathered and distributed by officials or academics — like annual crime statistics or Census databases. If no such data existed, then I thought journalists were out of luck.</p>
<p>But NICAR taught me that data can be so much more than official statistics.</p>
<p>So here’s how to channel your inner Nellie Bly and DIY (Do It Yourself) data.</p>
<p><b>Look at the notes in your notebook. </b>That’s data. When we take notes on something, say, a privately funded educational program, we record the 5 W’s. That’s data.</p>
<p>For inspiration, check out: <a href="http://homicidewatch.org/" target="_blank">Homicide Watch D.C.</a> This site gathers data from police reports, court documents and court hearings to examine every homicide in Washington, D.C. The thorough reporting allows the creators, Laura and Chris Amico, to analyze trends by race, location and more.</p>
<p><b>Documents are full of data</b>, we just don’t see it as such. When going through piles and piles of documents, record what you find in a database and turn it into data you can analyze.</p>
<p>Check out USA Today’s <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/mass-killings/index.html" target="_blank">“Behind the Bloodshed”</a> on mass killings in the United States. The FBI records murders in which four or more people died, but USA Today found dozens of such killings (the tan circles on the chart) of which the FBI had no record. The team turned to news reports, set Google Alerts and pored over thousands of police reports from killings across the country to find a truer picture of mass killings in the U.S.</p>
<p><b>And then there’s the Internet.</b> If you can’t find data on your subject, turn to Internet chat sites, social media and more. Turn your findings into data.</p>
<p>Check out Reuters’ <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1" target="_blank">“The Child Exchange.”</a> A Reuter’s reporter was researching adoptions online and came across a Yahoo group in which parents sought new homes for children they adopted from abroad and other people were looking for such kids to bring home. The practice is entirely unregulated, so a parent can sign away a child to a stranger and that’s that. Reporter Meghan Twohey took screenshots of every post about a child and recorded all data to track their ages, genders, whether they had behavioral problems and more.</p>
<p><b>Don’t forget science.</b> <b> </b>Curious about the water quality in your town? Take your own samples and send them into a lab. If you don’t trust the official report or no one is keeping track of an issue, use science to keep track of it yourself.</p>
<h1>So how do you do a DIY data project?</h1>
<p><b>1. Plan. Plan. Plan. </b>What do you want to know? What questions will you ask the data and people? Determine your methodology.</p>
<p><b>2. Dive in. </b>You have to start sometime.</p>
<p><b>3. Keep it manageable and quantifiable. </b>You can’t look at everything.</p>
<p><b>4. Bounce ideas off a partner or editor.</b></p>
<p><b>5. Don’t recreate the wheel. </b>Verify results and findings with academics and experts.</p>
<p><strong>6. Talk to people.</strong> Data can only go so far. It&#8217;s the people that make a story.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In the first of a series from Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR 14, Jason Hoppin explains the gift, and curse, of awareness in data journalism.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This is the first in a series of reports from three Digital First Media journalists who attended NICAR14 through the <a title="And the #NICAR14 Digital First Represents winners are …" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/12/20/nicar14-digital-represents-winners-are/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents program</a>.</em></p>
<p>There were close to 1,000 journalists at the <a href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/" target="_blank">2014 NICAR convention</a>, a nearly 50 percent increase over the prior year. That there were so many should tell you a few things: the idea of bending technology to serve journalism (especially investigatory journalism) is reaching a critical mass; the technology itself is accelerating; and people are starting to see how incredibly valuable this toolbox is to finding and telling stories.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. You’ve heard of the wildly popular (it raised $500,000 via Kickstarter) <a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title" target="_blank">NPR t-shirt project</a>? People who were at the conference helped create it.</p>
<p>You know the crazy story of how the Florida SunSentinel used toll booth information to calculate how fast off-duty cops were driving? Data guys were behind it, and won <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Public-Service" target="_blank">a Pulitzer Prize</a> for public service.</p>
<p>How about the LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-0301-lafd-hiring-20140301,0,5887646.story#axzz2uviWfQLN" target="_blank">recently plowing through hiring practices</a> at the LA Fire Department, leading to allegations of nepotism and quick vows of reform? A data guy is on the byline.</p>
<p>But what I most want to tell people about is a phenomenon that occurs to people at NICAR with any level of experience. This happened to me several times:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bQxpk69At2g/Uo7YI1wiJ-I/AAAAAAAABzc/CC9xxeuXR6Y/s1600/72917-hold-it-hold-it-what-the-hell-gfHV.gif" /></p>
<p>Once, someone showed me how to yank a table out of a PDF using <a title="Tabula" href="http://tabula.nerdpower.org/" target="_blank">Tabula</a>, software he helped write. This is normally like pulling a sword from a stone. Now all you have to do is click, drag and push enter.</p>
<p>Another time, a speaker who was showing us how to manipulate spreadsheets with <a title="OpenRefine" href="http://openrefine.org/" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> vowed: “What I’m going to show you is pure magic. It’s a miracle of modern technology.” We were skeptical. The work he was talking about can take hours. And then he compressed everything into a single click of a button, and the room nearly broke out in a riot. (This same phenomenon happened to someone I know — he had spent four hours that week working on something that our own <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/mwebster" target="_blank">Mary Jo Webster</a> showed him how to do in five minutes).</p>
<p>One speaker told us to buy a $20 European USB radio tuner on Amazon, and within a few keystrokes you could have a map of every airplane flying overhead at that moment show up on your browser. You could also do this for every large boat off shore. And tune into pretty much any public safety radio frequency.</p>
<p>I learned how to script a web app and publish to the Internet without using a backend database <i>or even a web server </i>from the guy who put all of Nate Silver’s stuff up on the New York Times website.</p>
<p>I learned how to use <a href="http://ban.jo" target="_blank">Ban.jo</a>, <a href="http://foursquare.com" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://geofeedia.com" target="_blank">Geofeedia</a> to find sources at breaking news scenes, with the latter searching multiple social media platforms within a defined radius, at a certain time. Think about that.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of creating your own data, and how to utilize government inspection reports or fracking data or the Census. We heard a million great ideas. And we heard the limitations on those great ideas, because it all still comes down to reporting and verifying the truth.</p>
<p>Someone else taught us how to use cheap audio sensors to collect noise data and do stories, and how to hack digital cameras to take infrared pictures to track environmental changes. That speaker also talked about drones, and how <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/" target="_blank">Google has developed a smartphone</a> that could potentially use the power of the crowd to digitize and map the interior spaces of, well … everything, everywhere.</p>
<p>I won’t veer off here into evangelism about how valuable this stuff is in an increasingly abstracted world, chopped into bits and bytes, quantified, and stored on a server somewhere in the middle of Kansas. Though the thought did cross my mind.</p>
<p>But I was inspired. And I felt more cunning in a way, as if I learned to think differently about this job. It’s not like I didn’t know this was possible — well, hacking digital cameras was definitely new — but it feels more attainable, very much within reach.</p>
<p>That is the curse. I have been stripped of my excuses. There were people at the conference who barely spoke English and were still trying to sit around the fire in search in insight. What reasons do I have left? My chore now is to go commit some journalism. It is a nice burden to have, especially when you feel armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>That LA Times database nerd who’s nailing the LAFD to the wall? His name is Ben Welsh. He spoke at the conference, and someone was geeky enough to upload a cell phone video of his talk to YouTube, as if Ben were Bruce Springsteen covering a Lorde song.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t me. But you should watch it. Seriously.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that our Digital First Represents contestants have completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we're ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents #NICAR14 contest.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p>In September, <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/09/30/nicar14-digital-first-represents/">we kicked off our contest</a> to send three journalists from Digital First Media papers to learn data journalism skills from the best in the business at Investigative Reporters and Editors&#8217; <a title="NICAR 14" href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/" target="_blank">2014 Computer-Assisted Reporting conference</a> in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Today, after our contestants completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we&#8217;re ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents <a title="#NICAR14 on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nicar14" target="_blank">#NICAR14</a> contest.</p>
<p>We received 18 entries from reporters and editors in every cluster of the company. From the Los Angeles Area News Group to New England, enterprising journalists with great ideas threw their hats into the ring.</p>
<p>We expected a lot from the folks who entered this contest. We asked them to jump through hoops that would introduce them to some of the training and support that our company and other journalism organizations can offer.</p>
<p><strong>1. They all had to join our data journalism discussion group</strong>, which now numbers more than 100 members from every DFM state and cluster. (If you&#8217;d like to join the conversation, email data editor Tom Meagher at <a href="mailto: tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>2. Everyone had to complete at least one online class in data journalism</strong>. Many took more than one class. For some, it was an afternoon of <a title="CartoDB Academy" href="http://cartodb.com/academy" target="_blank">interactive mapping with CartoDB</a>. For others, it was a weeks-long <a title="Udacity statistics" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/st101" target="_blank">statistics class from Udacity</a> or an <a title="Introduction to databases" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/db" target="_blank">introduction to databases on Coursera</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. For our judges, though, the most important requirement was that every entrant had to pitch a project</strong> they want to pursue with the skills they hope to learn at NICAR. Because the stories haven&#8217;t run yet, we can&#8217;t tell you too much about the winners&#8217; projects, but rest assured, they will chronicle their reporting process here on InsideThunderdome as their projects develop.</p>
<p>Enough throat clearing. You&#8217;re probably only reading this to find out who won the contest. So who did we decide on? Without further adieu&#8230;</p>

<p><strong><img class="wp-image-6017 alignleft" alt="Jason Hoppin, Santa Cruz Sentinel" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/photo-11-e1387557418744-150x150.jpg" width="105" height="105" /><a href="https://twitter.com/scnewsdude" target="_blank">Jason Hoppin</a></strong> is a reporter at the <a title="Santa Cruz Sentinel" href="http://santacruzsentinel.com/" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a>, covering the county and the environment in his hometown. Formerly at American Lawyer Media and the <a title="TwinCities.com" href="http://www.twincities.com/" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>, he has covered a number of beats in his career, including crime, state and federal courts, health care, politics and government at all levels. (And he still wants to try his hand at sports).</p>
<p>The winners were selected by our panel of judges, which included data editor <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/" target="_blank">Tom Meagher</a>, interactives editor <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins/" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a> and St. Paul Pioneer Press database editor <a title="MaryJo Webster on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine" target="_blank">MaryJo Webster</a>.</p>
<p>For each of the winners, Digital First Media will pay for the #NICAR14 conference registration and lodging. They (or their newsrooms) have to foot the bill for their travel to Baltimore. In return, the winners have some responsibilities. They will tweet several of the conference sessions. They will write about what they learn at NICAR14 for InsideThunderdome.com. They&#8217;ll also go back to their newsrooms and share their newfound knowledge.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the winners will put their new data skills to immediate use as they pursue significant, data-driven investigative projects in their newsrooms. After those stories run, they&#8217;ll show their work by writing about how they did it for InsideThunderdome.com.</p>
<p>NICAR 14 will be an incredible learning opportunity for these three DFM journalists. It&#8217;s regrettable that we can&#8217;t send more of our colleagues with great data reporting projects in the works as well. But we are confident that we count on Lindsey, Sean and Jason to channel their experience into some really compelling work that we can all learn from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-06-at-12.29.49-PM-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-06 at 12.29.49 PM" /></p><p>With shrinking budgets and shrinking newsrooms, it is easy to lose sight of the importance of design when putting out a newspaper, especially for smaller newsrooms where the task of just getting the paper to bed can be overwhelming. But there are ways to refocus your staff and improve your design, without spending more time and money.</p>
<p>Here are five design tips I gathered from different sessions held at the Society for News Design conference in Louisville, Ky., that any newsroom can enact.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Plan ahead</strong></h2>
<p>Bad layout happens because of a lack of planning, says <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelwhitley" target="_blank">Mike Whitley of the L.A. Times</a>. In his <a href="http://www.sndlou.com/news/2013/08/06/l-a-times-whitley-to-speak-at-sndlou/" target="_blank">SND presentation on the paper&#8217;s annual Oscar coverage</a> Whitley said not planning ahead for major event coverage, whether it be elections or a special series, can lead to design disasters on deadline. &#8220;That&#8217;s when the worst decisions and mistakes are made,&#8221; says Whitley.</p>
<p>Always make time to plan ahead for scheduled events. Review what content you will have and how it should be presented. Planning to put your headline over a large photo? Planning ahead will allow you to shoot the photo to accommodate it. Not sure if you need a kicker headline? Print out samples to see how it might look in the end. Always short on graphics or art? Thinking ahead and commissioning what you need will prevent gray design.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Be rich, but simple</strong></h2>
<p>In an attempt to make its website more beautiful and user friendly, the staff of <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com" target="_blank">National Geographic</a> refocused on the emotion of their site&#8217;s design and the message it was sending. Their Serengeti Lion video interactive online bucked their traditional site layout for large, standalone videos that brought their online users deeper into the lions&#8217; world. It is a simple design that immerses their readers in the content.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BirIeIHVHqA" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<div id="attachment_5702" style="width: 231px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Boston.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5702   " alt="FIT TO PRINT: Picture of the Boston Globe's front page from the Boston Marathon bombing. " src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Boston.jpg" width="221" height="376" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">FIT TO PRINT: The Boston Globe had many powerful images to choose from during their coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, but they didn&#8217;t cram it all into print.</p></div>
<p>Adding too many elements can take the focus away from the message and be distracting rather than enlightening. Weigh the importance of each design element and whether it would be better to leave it out. More doesn&#8217;t mean better.</p>
<p>It is better to use your best picture in a great way than to jam all the photos your staff took into print. Remember, you can always showcase every photo online.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe took this thinking to heart <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/boston-marathon-explosions" target="_blank">when covering the Boston Marathon bombings</a>. Rather than getting every great photo in, they edited it down to a few and only ran the very best.</p>
<h2>3. Steal from yourself</h2>
<p>&#8220;Look back at your work, it will give you perspective,&#8221; advised Whitley in his Oscars speech. If you have several different ideas for a project that you undertake every year, write the ones you don&#8217;t use down and refer to them the next time around. This will give you a starting point and put you ahead of the game when you begin to plan again.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t be afraid to repackage an old idea. &#8220;Different doesn&#8217;t mean better,&#8221; said Whitley. &#8220;Readers don&#8217;t remember things the way your newsroom does.&#8221; If a certain design style showcases your content best for a recurring event, don&#8217;t change it because you are bored, change it only if it truly improves the experience of your content.</p>
<h2>4. Take risks</h2>
<p>It is OK to admit something doesn&#8217;t work, says Whitley. Stop doing things because &#8220;we&#8217;ve always done it this way,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>Instead of a main photo to illustrate your story, why not think ahead and commission artwork instead?  Why not forgo a story entirely and instead create an infographic that expresses the same information in a more interesting way?</p>
<p>For their pre-Oscar coverage one year, the Times decided to forgo the usual cover photos for their section and instead commissioned several illustrations that when put side-by-side created one continuous poster celebrating the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>In 2013, the paper decided instead of placing notable quotes from stars at the top of pages in their awards coverage section, all the quotes were posted in bubbles on a back page, which garnered them much more attention.</p>
<p>Taking risks could mean a drastic change in your layout, or bucking your old content management system and choosing an alternative web design or outside site to better present your content.</p>
<h2>5. Solicit feedback</h2>
<p>Everyone can use feedback, from leaders to the lowest man on the totem pole, and it doesn&#8217;t require long meetings. It may be as simple as posting your layout or design ideas up for all to see and asking the rest of the staff to weigh in when they can.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be willing to hear others&#8217; ideas,&#8221; advised Whitley. You never know where serendipity could come from.</p>
<p>Try not to overreact to your work or the work of others, Whitley advised. And when you give feedback, make it constructive.</p>
<p>Remember, it takes everyone in your newsroom to make things great. No matter how big or small the team is.</p>

It takes time, collaboration, innovation and good relationships to balance it all out. (Thinkstock)" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the third in a series of reports from two Digital First Media journalists who attended SND through the <a title="Digital First Represents #SND13: And the winner is …" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/10/18/digital-first-represents-snd13-winner/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program. </em></p>
<p>There was a lot to take in from all the conference sessions and conversations I had <a title="#SNDLOU: Live updates from DFM’s Eileen Faust and Brian Harr" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/11/07/dfm-journalists-report-live-sndlou-workshop/">while at the SND conference last month</a>. There were many takeaways for me; collaboration, innovation — and yes — scaring your boss. Here’s a smattering of what I took away that can help us all focus on enhancing our storytelling:</p>
<h2><strong>Collaborate</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes we are islands. Working with others and doing it well is key to producing excellent journalism while at the same time putting energy into making others in the newsroom look better.</p>
<p>Many newsrooms already have a good working relationship with other departments. If not, develop a relationship with everyone, including and especially the digital staff. Even if your idea seems like a print-only idea, bring the digital folks into the process early on. And conversely, ask them to bring you into the process early on. It&#8217;s important to anticipate how the web and mobile presence of a project can increase the impact.</p>
<h2><strong>Innovate</strong></h2>
<p>Innovation should be important to every journalist, but it’s easy to get tripped up trying to follow trends. Falling into that can make us forget what we were trying to accomplish in the first place.</p>
<p>Innovate to solve problems, not to show off what you know.</p>
<p>As designers, especially for A1, the front page is still our biggest selling point. It’s a window to the rest of the paper. It all boils down to getting readers to read a story and so design is crucial. Letting design determine our front page content, however, is a concern. No matter how well it’s executed. It’s easy to over-photoshop or over-design. The question comes down to value. Are we helping or hurting the content by adding more to the design? Are we adding value to the content or just designing to be designing?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not passionate about your work and what you design, it’s evident to our readers. We need to demand more of ourselves and what we produce. We are in charge of protecting the integrity of our product.</p>

(Kenney Marlatt, @kenneymarlatt)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Scare your boss</b></h2>
<p>By far my favorite session from SND was from <a href="https://twitter.com/tmfrnk" target="_blank">Tim Frank</a> from the Asbury Park Design Studio. He tied together many of the recurring themes from the week. His session was titled “<a href="http://sndlouisville2013.sched.org/event/8d7bcdd091bff184166fd057ccbda8f5#.Up919WRDt2c" target="_blank">If you’re not scaring your boss, you’re not trying hard enough</a>.” Here’s a snapshot:</p>
<p>Quite often innovation in design is an act of subversion. This leads to questions from old-school editors asking, “How come you ran only two stories above the fold?” Or the photo editor questioning the photo edit.</p>
<p>Solving this begins with having it together. It’s not just, “Hey, what can we get away with?” To have the credibility to get away with something new you have to have your act together. Until you’re meeting deadline and things are running smoothly, you can’t ask to do outlandish things.</p>
<p>“There’s a fine line between an innovator and someone who’s just a pain in the butt,” Frank said.</p>
<p>In a different session I heard that handling A1 is often an entry-level position nowadays. While somewhat true, that doesn’t mean we can’t take charge of the page and act as the conductor. Articulate your ideas with fury. “This is the best solution, and I can tell you why!”</p>
<p>When it comes time to pitch something new or surprising, you want to already have a lot of trust built up with the decision makers. Without buy-in and collaboration, some great pages just won&#8217;t happen. Getting the editor and publisher to buy in to moving that ad on the back page so you can do a wrap with a photo around the front and back starts with good relationships.</p>
<p>But you can’t start huge. When you want to make changes, start small. Having established those relationships, then you can move on to scaring the boss.</p>
<h2><strong>Collaborated advice</strong></h2>
<p>Frank pulled together some nuggets of advice from great visual journalists around the world. Here they are in a mashup with some more verbs and stuff:</p>
<p><strong>You have to be able to articulate your ideas</strong>. Don’t present a half-baked design or presentation, let alone a half-baked idea. Before rushing in to your boss, get feedback from your colleague. They might see holes that you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipate what your boss would say. And not say</strong>. What the boss will not say might be your next option in case of rejection. If your idea is gunned down, don’t sulk. Quickly find another one. Think that there’s no best idea, only the best solution. If you introduce small changes as a progression toward what you want, things can happen. If you’re confident in your content. You don’t need to have X amount of things above the fold, or a story count, or anything like that &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Seize the day.</strong> When you don’t have anything to work with that’s when you have the biggest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>And some one liners, from Frank and others</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Your brain doesn’t pay attention to boring things.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be related to sex or outrageous. Just do amazing design.</p>
<p>Seduce your audience.</p>
<p>Sometimes you make a huge statement with what you don’t do.</p>
<p>You want to be the person that people want to listen to.</p>
<p>Make your arguments about the audience. “That’s a page that people will connect with.” It’s hard to argue against that.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/abortionmap-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="abortionmap" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the second in a series of reports from two Digital First Media journalists who attended SND through the <a title="Digital First Represents #SND13: And the winner is …" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/10/18/digital-first-represents-snd13-winner/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program. </em></p>
<p>We’ve all been guilty of it — desperate for art to break up the gray text of a school budget, graduation rate or tax story, we create a data table to illustrate the numbers or a map to show where the issue or event is playing out. Yet it doesn’t add much context.</p>
<p>Instead of falling prey to the standard chart or illustrative graphic that takes up space without adding to readers&#8217; understanding. Next time, take the extra time to call in some newsroom assistance that could help make your graphics and charts more informative and useful to readers. Here is some advice I learned at the Society for News Design (<a title="#SNDLOU: Live updates from DFM’s Eileen Faust and Brian Harr" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/11/07/dfm-journalists-report-live-sndlou-workshop/">SND</a>) workshop earlier this month.</p>
<p><strong>1. Your graphic or chart should strengthen the idea of your story. </strong>If it’s repetitious and doesn’t add to the story, is it really worth using?</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5096 alignright" alt="abortion map A" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/abortion-map-A.jpg" width="384" height="367" /></p>
<p>“Really good charts should provide memorable context,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdaniel" target="_blank">Jennifer Daniel</a>, New York Times graphics editor. In her Society for News Design speech, Daniels demonstrated what she meant by showing a plain graphic that illustrated where abortion was legal, similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_US_abortion_laws_pre-1973.svg" target="_blank">this one from Wikipedia:</a></p>
<p>Compare that to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/graphics/2013_bwg_abortion/ab_index_edit.html" target="_blank">this Businessweek graphic</a> which illustrates the myriad laws that govern abortion in each state, showing how the restrictions could be just as prohibitive as an outright ban. This takes the illustration much farther for readers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mapping an idea doesn’t always mean creating a map</strong>. Daniels encouraged us to think outside the box on how to graphically represent data to make it clearer, and more insightful. Ask yourself how your chart can reveal patterns in the data that would otherwise be hard to see.</p>
<p>“The information should reveal itself through the structure of the graphic,” says Daniels. That’s what makes good graphics work. Like this one from <a href="http://visual.ly/marathon-meal" target="_blank">Newman Design on Visual.ly</a> that shows how much walking you will have to do for each item on your Thanksgiving meal plate.</p>
<div class="visually_embed"><img class="visually_embed_infographic" alt="Marathon Meal" src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/marathon-meal_50290c06ab72e_w587.png" /></p>
<div class="visually_embed_cycle"><em>Explore more <a href="http://visual.ly">infographics</a> like this one on the web&#8217;s largest information design community &#8211; <a href="http://visual.ly">Visually</a>.</em></div>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Get feedback.</strong> The worst thing to do is to get locked into your own space, says Daniels. Instead, rely on the intelligence of the people around you, and don’t be overly protective of your ideas. Your coworkers may be able to see the idea in a new light and suggest a better way to illustrate the data or even suggest additional information that could add more context. The end result is not about you, it is about telling the story and creating the best infographic possible.</p>
<p><strong>4. Plan ahead.</strong> If you are always running stories about the same topics, or know a big project or story is in the works, start working on the graphic ahead of time so you don’t have to come up with a quick, weak version just to make your space less grey.</p>
<p><strong>5. Publish your print graphics on the web.</strong> There are numerous free and low-cost graphic makers available online that will give you both an interactive and print graphic. Check some of these out before starting your next illustrated project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#fusiontables" target="_blank"><strong>Fusion Tables</strong></a>: A free Google tool, this allows you to create maps and basic charts, and it is only limited by your imagination. Check out <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fusiontablestalks/stories" target="_blank">examples of graphs and maps others have created</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?kw=semgeneric&amp;sdid=JRSIH&amp;skwcid=AL!3085!3!28214304396!e!!g!!adobe%20illustrator&amp;ef_id=PQdQJWg@70gAAE45:20131120233427:s" target="_blank"><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></a>: Many newsrooms will have at least one copy of this software and at least one user who knows its ins and outs. Collaborate with them to make your vision a reality. Or, if there isn&#8217;t anyone versed in Illustrator, <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/19/adobe-illustrator-tutorials/" target="_blank">check out these free tutorials from Mashable</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://infogr.am" target="_blank"><strong>Infogr.am</strong></a>: This online graphics maker comes in free and pro versions. The free version doesn’t offer icons or a graphics library. You will have to add almost anything you are using, but it does provide you with a basic online graphic for free.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.easel.ly" target="_blank">Easel.ly</a></strong>: This site offers templates that you can work off of to create quick graphics if you aren’t comfortable using complex software. It’s free to use, and like it&#8217;s name implies, easy to use as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.piktochart.com" target="_blank"><strong>Piktochart</strong></a>: This site charges a monthly fee, though there are scales for subscription. It does offer a free trial.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com" target="_blank"><strong>Tableau</strong></a>: Downloadable software that allows you to create graphics offline. There are two versions; business and public use. Journalists can use the public online software available for free.</p>

<p>I returned to the <a href="http://www.dailynews.com" target="_blank">Daily News</a> newsroom from <a href="http://www.sndlou.com/" target="_blank">SND</a> <a title="#SNDLOU liveblog" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/live/sndlou-liveblog/" target="_blank">earlier this month</a> with a renewed vigor for my job as a designer and storyteller, and for doing it well. The experience was inspiring and challenging and it taught me that wherever I thought my design was before, there are countless levels still ahead of me.</p>
<p>SND reminded me how crucial design is to storytelling, especially in the digital age. It&#8217;s important for newsrooms to collaborate and involve designers from the earliest planning stages of any project. Using what I learned at SND earlier this month, I will be an advocate in my newsroom for improving the storytelling design across all platforms.</p>
<p>To that end, one of my favorite sessions at the conference was led by Twitter&#8217;s David Wright (<a href="https://twitter.com/dwjr">@dwjr</a>). The subject covered the relationship between platform and content. Among other things, he explained why &#8220;designers are uniquely qualified to solve some of the toughest problems facing newsrooms today.&#8221; Here are a few key takeaways:</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Know the differences between platforms<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Understanding the difference between platforms is essential to creating good work. Content design and platform design are very different animals. Here&#8217;s a quick compare and contrast:</span></span></p>
<p><em>Content</em> is exploratory, specific, custom and involves storytelling and pacing. It all adds up to the perfect page.</p>
<p><em>Platform</em> is rigid, general, template-driven and involves distribution and wayfinding. It all adds up to the perfect system.</p>
<p>Content thinks, &#8220;<em>How am I going to tell the story?</em>&#8221;<br />
Platform thinks, &#8220;<em>How am I going to distribute it?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Content asks, &#8220;<em>What is the best way to tell this story?</em>&#8221;<br />
Platform asks, &#8220;<em>What problem am I helping this reader solve?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/platform.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5047" alt="" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/platform.jpg" width="800" height="531" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Identify the problems</strong><br />
Design has an important roll in fixing broken platforms. Digital news design, for the most part, is still broken with many story pages feeling the same.</p>
<p>Pages are often filled with unnecessary junk, and things don&#8217;t work on mobile as intended.</p>
<p>A common problem is <em>overclutter</em> on news sites. How does the user know what’s important if everything’s important?</p>
<p>Display advertising is a completely failing business model. We have not been good stewards in our relationship with readers and display advertising.</p>
<p>A lot of things we currently produce don’t work on all platforms, so we run in to, “Sorry, you can&#8217;t watch this or play that on your iPad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Identifying the problems is the first step to solving them. If we ask ourselves what problems we can solve, the result is a better model than reacting to drops in readership.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your competition?</strong><br />
Pop quiz: Who do you think your competitive set is?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to sit in our cubicles with headphones on, and avoid our neighbors. A healthy workplace and environment is one that includes talking and challenging each other. Don’t limit your views of who your competition is or what your standards could be. We need to change our perception of competitive sets.</p>
<p>Why is Gmail so competitive? It is ubiquitous. Anyplace we go we have our Gmail.<br />
That’s also how our news should be.</p>
<p>Anything that we do should match the experience of what Gmail can do.</p>
<p><strong>Make connections</strong><br />
Our goal is to connect with visitors, and create relationships with them. Our goal is to have site visitors stay and hang around for more. Design plays a crucial role in helping news organizations make digital products that are inviting and engaging.</p>
<p>The battle for audience retention will be fought on platform. Platform design plays a crucial role in helping news organizations make effective digital products that will keep readers coming back, again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Find context</strong><br />
Design thinking can help by using context, research, empathy (user-centered) and synthesis.<br />
We get context by doing research. We research by observing people. The people we want to help are the ones we need to watch. Reaching them means going to where they are. We have to talk to these people. The research helps create empathy as we connect with the people. Watching helps you understand their friction points. The end result is finding context through the analysis of all of these observations.</p>
<p><strong>Sound bites<br />
</strong><em>A few other key takeaways I got from this session: </em><strong><br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">• Good experiences thrive in organizations where design is respected.<br />
</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">• Visual journalists are ready-made problem solvers.<br />
</span>• Observation helps challenge the status-quo.<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">• User tastes change and it’s effected by technology.<br />
</span>• It’s critical to pay attention, because we may be spending too much time in the wrong spots.<br />
• Google is free<br />
• Show, don’t tell<br />
• Users don’t hit the “back to top” button.<br />
• Design has to be a relentless advocate for good user experience.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: This is the tenth in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I attended the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/bring-your-social-game-to-the-pro-level/#.UoQpt5RgYRw" target="_blank">Pro-level Social session at ONA13</a>. Tons of great tips came out of this session, but one thing really stuck out for me. After being inundated with questions about Facebook&#8217;s algorithm, <a href="https://twitter.com/petersmeg" target="_blank">Meghan Peters</a>, who works in Strategic Partnerships for Facebook, said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s based off of connections. Our goal is to serve up the most relevant post to that individual user. It&#8217;s based on the user&#8217;s interactions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, it&#8217;s personalized, based on the interests and friends and &#8220;likes&#8221; for an individual user, to an extent. This stuck with me.</p>
<p>Language, voice and word choices probably matter. How people use Facebook in their day-to-day lives probably matters.</p>
<p>After I returned to the <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/" target="_blank">Morning Sun</a> from ONA, I decided to experiment with the voice and content of our daily <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MPmorningsun" target="_blank">Facebook</a> weather post, to see what factors affect how posts display in news feeds.</p>
<p>Our daily weather post has increased reach by 5-7 times or more since I&#8217;ve made these changes. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/274400362581037" target="_blank">Facebook defines &#8220;reach&#8221; as,</a> &#8220;The number of unique people who received impressions of a Page post. The reach number might be less than the impressions number since one person can see multiple impressions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BEFORE:</strong><br />
<a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/old-weather.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4973" alt="old weather" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/old-weather.jpg" width="420" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AFTER:</strong><br />
<a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-shot-2013-11-11-at-2.19.29-PM.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4974" alt="Screen shot 2013-11-11 at 2.19.29 PM" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-shot-2013-11-11-at-2.19.29-PM.jpg" width="438" height="383" /></a></p>
<p>Here is breakdown of the changes that helped increase the reach:</p>
<p><strong>Think SEO, but with more lifestyles relevance:</strong> I started by making changes to the language. Previous weather reports were more like bulletins. I wanted to add more immediacy, so I used words like &#8220;today,&#8221; &#8220;weather,&#8221; &#8220;mid-Michigan,&#8221; &#8220;central Michigan.&#8221; It appears that posts with timeliness, location and lifestyle information helped improve our reach.</p>
<p><strong>Be conversational</strong>: Our previous weather posts featured some all-caps writing, and a lot of ellipses and/or fragmented sentences. So, I changed the tone to a more conversational one. In scrolling through our newsfeed, I actually noticed that any post with all caps or sentence fragments had significantly less reach. I eliminated the impersonal tone, and watched the reach of our weather posts increase.</p>
<p><strong>Use active verb tense</strong>: Just like stories and photo captions, an active, present tense voice is more engaging and appears to improve reach.</p>
<p><strong>Time of day is important:</strong> I began posting our weather status between 5:30 and 6 a.m., which is a little earlier than before. Half of the reach numbers on these statuses were attained by 7 a.m., and the other half came throughout the day. Considering when the information is most relevant to the community may get more views in news feeds.</p>
<p><strong>Does the poster matter?</strong> We have several admins for our Facebook page. Do posts made by more Facebook-engaged users get more reach? Maybe. I am pretty engaged, and my posts on our branded page nearly always have higher numbers than other admins who aren&#8217;t as engaged overall. With our weather, when I took over posting the weather after ONA, our numbers went up. It&#8217;s something to consider, and something I am watching.</p>
<p>The reach numbers, and the differences between the two styles, are about average for us. So changing our style increased our engagement tremendously.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br />
What do you think of these suggestions? Have you noticed any factors on your own Facebook page that can improve reach and engagement?</p>
