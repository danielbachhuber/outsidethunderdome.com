(Ben Garvin, St. Paul Pioneer Press)" /></p><p><strong>Ben Garvin</strong> of the<b> </b>St. Paul Pioneer Press won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/25/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Visual Journalism DFMie</a> for his photos of faces as runners finished the Twin Cities Marathon.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">We did a standard photo gallery of the Twin Cities Marathon, one of the biggest events of the year. But Ben Garvin also told the story from an especially rich angle of view, too: the <a title="Faces of the Marathon" href="http://photos.twincities.com/2013/10/06/moments-from-the-finish-line/">faces of runners as they crossed the finish line</a>. (Be sure to click all the way through.)</span></p>
<p>This caption-less gallery also turned out to be our most popular of the year, with 389,000 page views.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>We choose the marathon story because it was a clever conceptual approach to a yearly sports news story. The photographer managed to capture the range and breadth of the story with a series of images that were filled with joy and happiness, and inspired those same emotions in the judges. Some of the images were surprising, some made us laugh and there was even a narrative arc to the sequencing. Congrats for the out-of-the box thinking.</p></blockquote>

This photo was part of his winning entry for the DFMie for visual journalism." /></p><div id="attachment_3324" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/daily-local-news/tom-kelly-iv-wins-dfmie-visual-journalism/tom-kelly-iv/" rel="attachment wp-att-3324"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3324" alt="Tom Kelly IV" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Tom-Kelly-IV-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tom Kelly IV</p></div>
<p><a title="Tom Kelly IV" href="http://www.tk4photo.blogspot.com/">Tom Kelly IV</a> of the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa., wins the DFMie for the best visual journalism of 2012.</p>
<p>His editor&#8217;s nomination explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>These photographs were chosen for a number of reasons, but most importantly the impact they had on the print edition readers and web version viewers. These photos include photographing a hot air balloon from above, documenting police talking a man off a ledge six stories up, the thrill of victory for a local football team, the loss of a firefighter, the murder of a police officer, and the burial of a Marine. Then the funerals for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting, and the burial of 57 Irish railroad laborers who died in 1832. Great work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained their selection:</p>
<blockquote><p>We chose Tom Kelly of the Daily Local News for the artistry of his individual shots, the focus on moments within moments in many of the photographs that conveyed the joy, the grief or the solemnity of the events. This photographer reminded us that in a world of fast-moving, high-definition images packaged with sound and words, sometimes a simple, well-composed image still speaks volumes.</p></blockquote>
