				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Dave-Orrick-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Dave Orrick, self-portrait at a campsite on Isabella Lake while reporting on the Pagami Creek Fire in the Boundary Waters." /></p><p><a title="Dave Orrick" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/daveorrick">Dave Orrick</a>, outdoors editor of the Pioneer Press, wins the DFMie for feature/lifestyle/entertainment journalism for his reporting on a forest rebounding from a wildfire.</p>
<p>Editor Mike Burbach explained the coverage in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost every media outlet in the state covered the Pagami Creek Wildfire of 2011. It captured attention with its destructive power and beauty.</p>
<p>Not many came back to revisit the scene, though. Orrick did, and found it &#8220;<a title="After the Pagami fire, Boundary Waters is open for business" href="http://www.twincities.com/ci_20654785">open for business</a>,&#8221; but home to <a title="Strange beauty of the scorched BWCA" href="http://www.twincities.com/ci_20713875/dave-orrick-strange-beauty-scorched-bwca?source=pkg">strange beauty in charred trees</a> and testimony to nature&#8217;s recuperative power. Orrick spent a week hoofing and canoeing to document what had &#8212; and <a title="Ely, Minn., reflects on the wildfire that could have been" href="http://www.twincities.com/ci_20670002">hadn&#8217;t &#8212; changed</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges say why they chose Orrick as the feature winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>In simple yet vivid language, Dave Orrick&#8217;s stories of the Pagami fire explain the complex choreography between a forest fire, emergency responders, residents and rangers. Orrick shows the beauty and devastation of the fire&#8217;s aftermath, taking readers along charred paths, navigating spearlike remains of fir trunks and seeking respite from the &#8220;plague&#8221; of biting flies &#8212; all while seeking glimpses of rebirth. In his opening article, he warns the readers that his accounts will be poor substitute for seeing it themselves, but his recounting brings them pretty close.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists in the feature/lifestyle/entertainment category were:</p>

</ul>
<p>As outdoors editor for the Pioneer Press, Orrick fishes, paddles, hunts, skis and romps across the region while staying on top of outdoors news. Before this dream job, he was on the politics team, covering the Capitol and St. Paul City Hall. The New England native spent most of his adult life in an around Chicago, covering politics, corruption, child welfare and the environment before joining the Pioneer Press in 2006. The 42-year-old lives in St. Paul with his wife and son.</p>
<p>Appropriately, he learned of his DFMie award in a fishing boat on his cellphone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2012/11/features-persona-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="features-persona" /></p><p>Even a hurricane couldn&#8217;t stop the magnetic force of the Thunderdome. During the second week of November the entire staff gathered for the first time since inception.</p>
<p>The features team is spread across the United States so it was especially great to officially meet, form ideas and really understand how we can work as a team to empower local newsrooms. We learned a lot about each other and Thunderdome. We wanted to share a couple of the factoids we personally found to be most surprising.</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jhendrickson/"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-452 alignright" title="John-Hendrickson_avatar-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/John-Hendrickson_avatar-300x300-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jhendrickson/"><strong>John Hendrickson, Entertainment Channel Manager</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I learned that Bobby was married.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: I was surprised by the amazing resumes of so many people at the Dome (Washington Post, NYT, AP). Quite intimidating!</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mgrisafi/"><strong><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-463 alignright" title="Matt-Grisafi_avatar_1-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Matt-Grisafi_avatar_1-300x3001-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" />Matt Grisafi, Health and Food Channel Manager</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I guess I’ll say I was surprised by John’s ability to identify marginal celebrities in the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: As far as Thunderdome goes, surprised might not be the right word, but I thought it was pretty great just how personable and unassuming everyone was (Ryan aside, haha). Some pretty impressive resumes in the group and opportunities for egos to clash, but I didn’t really see any of that. Pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mcorones/"><strong><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-464" title="Michael-Corones_avatar-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Michael-Corones_avatar-300x3001-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" />Mike Corones, Technology Channel Manager</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I was pretty surprised that Jeremy is having a daughter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: I was very pleasantly surprised at how effectively features worked together to create initial Entertainment personas.</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/kmetz/"><strong><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-465" title="Kelly-Metz_avatar-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Kelly-Metz_avatar-300x300-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" />Kelly Metz, Features Producer</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I was surprised and found it hysterical that one reason Ryan doesn’t like going to sports games is because he doesn’t like large agreeable crowds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: I am surprised and impressed we all got along so well and have the same vision for what Thunderdome is and could be. We all just want to do something to help local newsrooms and we make an exceptional team.</p>
