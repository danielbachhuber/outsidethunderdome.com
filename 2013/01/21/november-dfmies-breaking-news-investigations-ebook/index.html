<h3>Fire coverage was a team effort</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1034" alt="Nov 25 Sentinel &amp; Enterprise" src="../../../../content/uploads/2013/01/Nov-25-Sentinel-Enterprise-532x1024.jpg" width="532" height="1024" /> We changed the DFMie contest rules for November, allowing for staff entries, rather than just entries for work by one or two journalists. The winning entry of the <a title="Sentinel and Enterprise" href="http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/">Sentinel &amp; Enterprise</a>, based in Fitchburg, Mass., illustrates why it was important for us to recognize teamwork. This breaking news story involved teamwork by several S&amp;E staffers, colleagues at the <a title="Lowell Sun" href="http://www.lowellsun.com/">Lowell Sun</a>, the publisher, circulation department and production. Even the daughter of an advertising staff member contributed (that&#8217;s her photo at the top of the front page).</p>
<p>Editor <a title="Charles St. Amand" href="https://twitter.com/CharlesStAmand">Charles St. Amand</a> detailed the teamwork in his nomination (lightly edited, as nominations and judges&#8217; comments are elsewhere in this post):</p>
<blockquote><p>We lost our Leominster bureau in a five-alarm fire that ravaged the Columbia Hotel building on the night of Saturday, Nov. 24. We’ll bounce back, but more than 30 people were left homeless and eight other small businesses were lost. Our coverage of the fire and its aftermath was truly a team effort, with the Sentinel &amp; Enterprise&#8217;s staff working with editors and reporters in the Sun newsroom to put out an extra print edition that night while getting the most up-to-date information and photos to our online readers.</p>
<p><a title="Michael Hartwell" href="https://twitter.com/SEHartwell">Michael Hartwell</a>, one of our reporters was heading home after a night out to his apartment in Leominster when he came upon the fire. He immediately grabbed a notebook in his car and his smartpone and went to work, tweeting from the fire scene, shooting a few video clips, and alerting the copy desk in Lowell.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p><a title="http://yfrog.com/od6yhgzj" href="http://t.co/QfmOr3oF">yfrog.com/od6yhgzj</a> the roof of our Leominster bureau building us on fire</p>
<p>— Michael Hartwell (@SEHartwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/SEHartwell/status/272549728380657664">November 25, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Sun police reporter <a title="Rob Mills" href="https://twitter.com/Robert_Mills">Rob Mills</a> got wind of the fire from the police/fire scanner in the Lowell newsroom and had already started working. Michael on the scene in Leominster and Rob working in Lowell cobbled together a story, and the Sentinel &amp; Enterprise was <a title="Leominster fire coverage" href="http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/ci_22061198/four-alarm-fire-downtown-leominster">first with the breaking news</a>, beating the Telegram &amp; Gazette of Worcester by at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Advertising administrator, <a title="Holly Conry" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/holly-conry/49/899/a06">Holly Conry</a>, heard about the fire and went to the scene with her teenage kids. It was Holly&#8217;s 13-year-old daughter Erin&#8217;s photo that ran Page 1 for the extra edition (although her big brother, Kyle, was erroneously credited).</p>
<p>S&amp;E reporter <a title="Katina Caraganis" href="https://twitter.com/kcaraganis">Katina Caraganis</a>, who lives not far from the bureau, also went to the scene and fed the Lowell copy desk with quotes and color. A photo she took at the scene ran on the jump.</p>
<p>We learned about the fire about an hour after we had sent our Sunday edition to production, and it looked like we were too late to get a chaser out. I called Publisher Mark O&#8217;Neil and asked if we could print an extra for the Sentinel &amp; Enterprise so we could get fire coverage to Leominster, our biggest-circulating community. He approved the move without hesitation. We knew there would be an expectation from our readers to see coverage in their hometown paper the next day. &#8230; We alerted folks in circulation, too, so they knew they were getting extra papers for Leominster home delivery and the best-selling newsstands and boxes in the city.</p>
<p><a title="Bruce Phillips" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bruce-phillips/5b/463/553">Bruce Phillips</a> and <a title="Dan O'Brien" href="https://twitter.com/dobrien_thesun">Dan O&#8217;Brien</a> on the universal copy desk in Lowell took care of producing a partial remake of Page 1, while I was able to use the same story and pics to post to sentinelandenterprise.com. Shortly thereafter, one of our photo stringers, <a title="Jonathon Route" href="http://www.pixoto.com/jroute13b">Jonathon Route</a>, sent me some amazing shots from the fire that I was able to associate with the story online (by then the extra had already been sent to the presses).</p>
<p>The following day, <a title="Nick Mallard" href="https://twitter.com/n_mallard">Nick Mallard</a> (an S&amp;E sports reporter who works a GA shift on Sunday) teamed with Leominster reporter <a title="Jack Minch" href="https://twitter.com/JackMinch">Jack Minch</a> to work on <a title="Fire folo story" href="http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/ci_22066606/mazzarella-says-building-hit-by-blaze-will-probably">strong</a> <a title="Fire folo story" href="http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/ci_22066606/mazzarella-says-building-hit-by-blaze-will-probably">folos</a> to the fire, while S&amp;E photographer/videographer John Love shot photos and video that we posted online throughout the day. We also updated story on the web.</p>
<p>On Monday, we continued coverage throughout the day online and for print, with John Love scoring pics of the building from the rooftop of a neighboring building and video of a wall being taken down in the back of the building. Universal desk editors <a title="Bianca Pavoncello" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bianca-pavoncello/38/a0a/726">Bianca Pavoncello</a> and <a title="Dan Phelps" href="https://twitter.com/PhelpsSun">Dan Phelps</a> in Lowell did the S&amp;E print designs for Monday and Tuesday, respectively.</p>
<p>This team effort, across several departments (Editorial, Prepress, Pressroom, Mailroom, Circulation) at three different sites (Fitchburg, Lowell and Devens) was a success in print and online.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges echoed St. Amand&#8217;s praise for the team effort:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every newspaper covers big breaking stories on deadline. Some do it well and some not so well. But to do it exceedingly well, as did the Sentinel &amp; Enterprise, when the paper&#8217;s bureau closest to the story — a five-alarm fire — is one of the businesses destroyed by the blaze, speaks to the quality, dedication and professionalism of the entire news staff, print and online, as well as the production and circulation departments, among others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe the Sentinel and Enterprise staff really pulled the whole story together with storytelling through photographs and video. The follow up stories also provided the readers with the true impact on the merchants, residents and city.</p></blockquote>
<p>For staff awards, prize money goes for a newsroom staff party, rather than to individuals. For teamwork this thorough, the Sentinel &amp; Enterprise news staff better invite some colleagues from other departments and from Lowell to come join in the fun.</p>
<p>The other Northeast finalists were <a title="Jim Shelton" href="https://twitter.com/JimboShelton">Jim Shelton</a> of the New Haven Register for his <a title="Jim Shelton coverage of Yale president" href="http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2012/11/08/news/new_haven/doc509c0846452ec068755302.txt?viewmode=fullstory">coverage of Yale University&#8217;s selection of a new president</a> and <a title="Kevin Moran" href="https://twitter.com/iamberkshire">Kevin Moran</a> of the Berkshire Eagle for an interactive election-results map.</p>
<h3>Doug Saunders hustled on al-Qaida arrests</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1197" alt="November DFMies Saunders" src="../../../../content/uploads/2013/01/November-DFMies-Saunders.jpg" width="667" height="593" /><a title="Doug Saunders" href="https://twitter.com/crimeshutterbug">Doug Saunders</a> provided swift and thorough coverage of the story of the <a title="Doug Saunders coverage of al-Qaida arrests" href="http://www.dailybulletin.com/ci_22033178">arrests of four Southern California men</a> who were accused of plotting to join al-Qaida in Afghanistan. And he stayed in front as the national story developed. Los Angeles News Group Vice President and Executive Editor <a title="Michael Anastasi" href="https://twitter.com/ma_anastasi">Michael Anastasi</a> explained in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite being off-hours and after print deadline, Doug posted an article on our website almost immediately after the news broke. He continued to work on the article through the night and provided readers with a detailed understanding of the breakup of the terrorist cell. The next day, Doug came in to the office and took point on this <a title="Terror plot lawyer questions ..." href="http://www.dailybulletin.com/preps/ci_22149545/terror-plot-lawyer-questions-militarys-handling-terror-suspect">national story</a>. He wrote the mainbar for the article and helped lead the newsroom on how to cover the event. He worked with reporters, photographers and online staffers and exhibited all the qualities that one would expect from a leader. His article was detailed, thorough and an easy read resulting in accolades from Digital First management.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie rules present the awards for single stories and the judges chose the a-Qaida story as the November winner for the LANG cluster. But Anastasi actually nominated Saunders for two stories, a <a title="Triple murder story" href="http://www.dailybulletin.com/crime/ci_22068621/triple-homicide-this-morning-ontario">triple murder</a> and the <a title="Ontario police backtrack ..." href="http://www.dailybulletin.com/ontario/ci_22099107/ontario-police-backtrack-where-drugs-were-found-at">subsequent investigation</a>, in addition to the al-Qaida story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doug responded to not one but two major incidents of statewide, if not national, significance this past month. In doing so, he showcased his journalism chops not just through the written word, but also in photography, video and social media. &#8230;</p>
<p>Doug, a veteran who has served in Afghanistan and Iraq, is an absolute professional. Respectful and helpful, Doug has been one of the best additions to this newsroom in years. He is a a good writer, a strong reporter and an even better interviewer. This company is fortunate to have his name appear in their newspapers.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>It certainly is a big deal to break what became a national story, and Doug took the bull by the horns with his aggressive work during off hours and after deadline. The piece is well-written and complete with follow up stories, photo galleries and Storify. A comprehensive, sound job.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other LANG finalists were a clusterwide team effort for <a title="Honoring all who served" href="http://www.sbsun.com/ci_21972410/honoring-all-who-served">Veterans Day</a> and the <a title="Election Day liveblog" href="http://live.dailynews.com/Event/Election_2012_Inland_Empire_live_coverage?Page=0">Election Day blog</a> of the Inland Daily Bulletin.</p>
<h3>Jennifer Poole uncovered huge problem for schools</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199" alt="November DFMies Willits" src="../../../../content/uploads/2013/01/November-DFMies-Willits.jpg" width="668" height="269" />Our first DFMie winner from a non-daily print newsroom is a classic example of watchdog reporting by Jennifer Poole of the <a title="Willits News" href="http://www.willitsnews.com/">Willits News</a>, winner of the November DFMie in the Northern California cluster. The nomination from Online Editor Linda Williams explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since late October The Willits News reporter Jennifer Poole has been tenaciously uncovering poor financial management of the Willits Unified School District bond.</p>
<p>She has uncovered a $5 million bond balloon payment due in 2014 the school administration said they were unaware of. This unknown payment could have bankrupted the district had it not been discovered before the contract for $3.75 million construction project was finalized. The district had actually awarded this contract despite not having enough money to pay for it. She discovered this while examining the bond repayment obligations for district property owners that resulted in a surprise four-fold increase in school bond taxes.</p>
<p>Her <a title="School bond property tax increases" href="http://www.willitsnews.com/ci_21844584/school-bond-property-taxes-will-increase-fourfold">initial story</a> initiated a growing series of disclosures within the district and a subsequent The Willits News editorial calling for the current school board to either resign or change their methods and priorities. One school board member has resigned and the Mendocino County Office of Education has stepped in to help resolve the issue.</p>
<p><a title="Willits school bond story" href="http://www.willitsnews.com/ci_22092829/willits-exotic-school-bonds-more-questions-than-answers">Jennifer&#8217;s next discovery</a> was the district&#8217;s use of Capital Appreciation Bonds for financing current school projects at the expense of future generations and an expanded look at the way this method of financing has become <a title="Willits joins 200 other California districts ..." href="http://www.willitsnews.com/ci_22129745/willits-joins-200-other-california-school-districts-that">pervasive throughout California</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>How many beat reporters would take the pains she did to identify and make sense to readers the significance of the school bond payments mess? My guess is not many. For me, Jennifer&#8217;s stories epitomize the kind of work that is not only invaluable to the community — which pays the taxes, after all — but it is work that simply cannot be duplicated. As we all know, that&#8217;s one of the great strengths of a community newspaper. What else can one say? It&#8217;s just exemplary journalism that any news organization would be proud of.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poole’s coverage showed commitment to investigating and digging into a financial situation and also a commitment to the readers by sticking with the story. The use of money by school districts is of utmost importance to parents, as well as every taxpayer living in that district. By acting as the watchdog of the school district, Poole not only alerted officials to the financial problem before it could have potentially bankrupted them but also provided a great community service. Parents and taxpayers may not have otherwise known what was going on in the school district had Poole not continued to dig into the story. Additionally, her stories provided more context and in-depth reporting that just a run-down of what happened at a school board meeting. Online, each part of the series also has a timeline linking back to other stories providing a clear-cut and easy way to digitally navigate the story’s progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other NorCal finalists were Mario Sevilla for the regional election coverage display he developed and Mandy Feder&#8217;s coverage for the Lake County Record-Bee of a <a title="Lake County Record-Bee story" href="http://www.record-bee.com/ci_22095410/lakeview-market-receives-notice-permanent-disqualification-from-ebt?IADID=Search-www.record-bee.com-www.record-bee.com">local market&#8217;s disqualification from the food stamps electronic benefit program</a>.</p>
<h3>Chris Roberts leaves El Paso a winner</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1204" alt="November dfmies el paso" src="../../../../content/uploads/2013/01/November-dfmies-el-paso.jpg" width="650" height="391" /><a title="El Paso Times" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/">El Paso Times</a> reporter <a title="Chris Roberts" href="https://twitter.com/4estate">Chris Roberts</a> wrote about a <a title="El Paso Times story" href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_21974392/va-nixes-shelter-vets-agency-fails-local-building?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com">failed Veterans Affairs program</a> for Veterans Day, winning the November DFMie for the Texas/New Mexico cluster. By the time the judges chose him as a winner, Roberts had a new job, though still with Digital First in the Tex/Mex cluster. He started work in January as the new <a title="Daily Times welcomes new managing editor" href="http://www.daily-times.com/ci_22299122/daily-times-welcomes-new-managing-editor-chris-roberts">managing editor of the Farmington Daily Times</a>.</p>
<p>El Paso Times Editor <a title="Bob Moore" href="https://twitter.com/BobMooreNews">Bob Moore</a> summarized the story in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a Veterans Day special report, El Paso Times reporter Chris Roberts documented how the VA bureaucracy got in the way of an innovative program for homeless veterans, despite the Obama administration’s pledge to end veteran homelessness by 2015.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>His story about VA bureaucracy getting in the way of helping homeless vets is maddening. I say that as a compliment. I&#8217;m sure readers felt the same way as Chris writes, point by point, describing how this shelter facility meets every kind of inspection rating possible, except ones established by the VA. Of course we don&#8217;t know what those standards are because, as Chris writes, the VA won&#8217;t talk in specifics. As Chris surely knows, vets make up a disproportionate number of the homeless on America&#8217;s streets. It&#8217;s nothing short of a travesty. And yet here is a project that would help 50 vets in El Paso, which has a strong military presence/tradition. (I can tell you this because I was born in El Paso while my father was serving at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.) This story is a perfect example of watchdog journalism. Chris simply lays out the facts in black and white. He allows VA officials to have their say. Readers can make up their own minds what to think about the situation. But let&#8217;s be honest: There&#8217;s only one thing to think after reading this fine work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chris&#8217;s article documenting how the VA bureaucracy got in the way of an innovative program for homeless veterans, despite Obama&#8217;s pledge to end veteran homelessness by 2015 was riveting, and a great piece of investigative, hard-nosed journalism.</p>
<p>Chris should be commended for his excellent article, for informing the community and El Paso Times readers on an issue that should be front and center in the minds of Americans.</p>
<p>Chris wrote an article that was necessary and needed. He showed great journalist instincts and really hit it out of the park. This is exactly what journalism is about.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Patti Mengers&#8217; reporting stops Sony bullying</h3>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='625' height='382' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZjwzcBTCxOo?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><br />
Journalists like to say that we afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. <a title="Patti Mengers" href="http://dtimesbios.wordpress.com/patti-mengers/">Patti Mengers</a>, a 37-year veteran of the <a title="Daily Times of Delaware County" href="http://delcotimes.com/">Daily Times</a> of Delaware County, Pa., did both in winning the November DFMie for the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster. Editor <a title="Phil Heron" href="https://twitter.com/PhilHeron">Phil Heron</a>&#8216;s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Staffer Patti Mengers took on the case of a group of kids at Lansdowne Library that had made a video to promote reading among young people.</p>
<p>But they ran into <a title="Patti Mengers story on music video dispute" href="http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2012/11/27/news/doc50b446e88d0c7348447352.txt">copyright problems</a> with Sony Music and the estate of Michael Jackson. The video, ‘Read It,’ was done as a parody to Jackson’s class ‘Beat It.’ Sony or YouTube took the video down, the kids turned to us and we went to bat for them, in both our news pages, <a title="Delco Times editorial" href="http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2012/11/28/opinion/doc50b59a25910b6942643201.txt">editorial</a>, blogs, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>The result? The powers that be relented, the video went back up, and a big win for some local kids trying to do a good thing.</p>
<p>Note: At one point the folks at Sony actually indicated they thought they could get the Jackson estate to change their tune, but ONLY if no story was done. I quickly shot that theory down.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the many responsibilities of a newspaper is to report not only on the doings of elected officials, government agencies, civic groups, business and religious leaders and other movers and shakers in a community, but on those of lesser stature who are often powerless to make their voices heard above the din.</p>
<p>It is clear after reading Patti Mengers&#8217; stories on a group of young people at the Lansdowne Library who got into a copyright dispute with Sony Music and the Michael Jackson Estate that the Delco Times in Pennsylvania&#8217;s Delaware County takes that responsibility seriously. More important, it is equally clear to readers — and their teen-age sons and daughters — that their newspaper is a living presence in the community, a watchdog with a heart and a soul.</p>
<p>This group of kids wanted nothing more than to promote reading among young people. To advance this worthy cause, they knew they had to speak to their fellow teenagers in a language they would understand and appreciate. The video titled &#8220;Read It!&#8221; was a takeoff on Michael Jackson&#8217;s teen anthem &#8220;Beat it!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Sony Music and the Jackson estate squawked, having the video taken off YouTube, the enterprising kids went to the newspaper for help. And that is what they got, thanks to Mengers&#8217; dogged reporting and the newspaper&#8217;s excellent use of multiple platforms — news and editorial pages, video, blogs, Twitter and Facebook — to not only tell this story, but by doing so meticulously, to force corporate giant Sony to retreat, step by step, and then drop the matter altogether.</p>
<p>Mengers&#8217; stories reflect a relentless effort to seek out all the parties involved, to gain a commanding grasp of the sometimes complicated issues and to present them clearly and with unimpeachable authority. Her stories are precisely what such stories should be: Fair, accurate, painstakingly thorough, and written by one who clearly has a gift for storytelling.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other PA/NJ/WV finalists were Amy Stansburry of the Evening Sun in Hanover, Pa., for a story on migrant workers and Diane Hoffmann and Eileen Faust of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., for their <a title="Pottstown Mercury literacy campaign" href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/20121113/NEWS01/121119872/0/SEARCH/pottstown-s-ywca-program-offers-a-step-up-to-a-better-life-%28video-added%29">community</a> <a title="Pottstown literacy campaign form" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dEJLd0Z4NTBCZm44NWk3V2NjYkpIdHc6MQ#gid=0">literacy project</a>.</p>
<h3>Pioneer Press map reflects six years of work</h3>

Editor <a title="Mike Burbach" href="https://twitter.com/mikeburbachPP">Mike Burbach</a>&#8216;s nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drawing on the past six years of &#8220;family outings&#8221; reporting by <a title="Maja Beckstrom" href="https://www.facebook.com/majabeckstrom?ref=tn_tnmn">Maja Beckstrom</a>, database editor/reporter <a title="MaryJo Webster" href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine">MaryJo Webster</a>, Deputy Editor <a title="Jen Westpfahl" href="http://about.me/jenniferw">Jen Westpfahl</a> created a clickable, <a title="Family Outings map" href="http://www.twincities.com/family">searchable, color-coded map</a> that links to those reports.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not breaking news. It&#8217;s not an investigation that reveals official corruption. It&#8217;s not an intricately drawn portrait of a controversial figure. But it is useful and local and efficient. It assembles a body of what began as primarily print work, adds value to it and makes it easily update-able. It&#8217;s an approach that also is replicable for any number of subjects. This far, it has attracted 11,000 uses.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Beckstrom&#8217;s lede on our early <a title="TwinCities.com story on Family Outings map" href="http://www.twincities.com/ci_21958163/make-memories-our-new-family-outings-planner">November story</a> announcing the database:</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past six years, my children and I have paddled a kayak through the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes, gazed on paintings at the Museum of Russian Art and climbed the servants&#8217; staircase at the historic James J. Hill mansion. We&#8217;ve hit baseballs at a batting cage and pulled bowstrings at an indoor archery range and pieced together mosaics at a local art studio. In all, I&#8217;ve brought my kids to more than 130 places around the Twin Cities and written about them in our regular Family Outings feature. Now you can find these Family Outings online in one easy place. The Pioneer Press has launched a clickable and searchable Google map that links to stories in our archives. Find it at twincities.com/family. I hope they help you plan your own excursions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just a great, quirky, interactive idea that is a fabulous reader service. My kids are grown now, but we moved around quite a bit especially when our youngest was still a pre-teen. I would have LOVED a tool such as this to find available places to go and things to see when we moved to a new market. And I imagine that even if you grew up in the Twin Cities, you might not know that some of these attractions existed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to find out some basic information about tours, interesting sites and activities. But then to be able to click on an interesting story that gives more detail? That&#8217;s the real plus here. It&#8217;s one-stop shopping, so to speak, for families looking to find new ways to spend weekends and keep the kids busy.</p>
<p>It may not be watchdog journalism, but it absolutely is news you can use. I have to imagine that the map is a popular destination on the Press web site. For that reason, I would think that advertisers also would want to be associated with a page like this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>A great way to transform prior columns into a useful, ongoing resource for families or just about anyone looking to explore the Twin Cities. Combining the map with search appears to make it easy to quickly pinpoint activities and promote readers&#8217; engagement with the community. There are some solicitations for readers to provide feedback, but it would interesting to see it expanded to better incorporate tips and advice from readers.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Wish Book and Share the Spirit</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1216" alt="November DFMies Wish Book" src="../../../../content/uploads/2013/01/November-DFMies-Wish-Book.jpg" width="624" height="613" />East Bay Metro Editor <a title="Kat Rowlands" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/katherine-ann-rowlands/14/478/524/">Kat Rowlands</a> and Research Director <a title="Leigh Poitinger" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/leighpoitinger/">Leigh Poitinger</a> won the Bay Area News Group DFMie for their work to update and improve two holiday charity drives. BANG Editor <a title="Dave Butler" href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/blog/leaders/david_butler.php">Dave Butler</a> explained in his nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/01/10/november-dfmies-share/" rel="attachment wp-att-1217"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1217" alt="November DFMies Share" src="../../../../content/uploads/2013/01/November-DFMies-Share-282x300.jpg" width="282" height="300" /></a>Under the leadership of BANG&#8217;s research director and its East Bay Metro editor, we&#8217;ve been involved in a major effort to upgrade our two historic holiday giving programs, the Mercury News <a title="Wish Book" href="http://mercurynews.info/wishbook/">Wish Book</a> and the East Bay&#8217;s <a title="Share the Spirit" href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_22117329">Share the Spirit</a>.</p>
<p>We identified three issues that could be addressed immediately: The East Bay stories weren&#8217;t human enough, they weren&#8217;t played well enough, and we had no online contribution mechanism. We fixed the last issue working with our community partner, the Volunteer Center of the East Bay, while simultaneously revamping the Mercury News contribution widget to make it easier to use.</p>
<p>Then, to increase the quality of our story offerings and allow us to give them A1 and local front play, we held meetings at the Mercury News and the Contra Costa Times with a total of about 50 local non-profit executives who supply the &#8220;wishes&#8221; that readers donate to fulfill. Our message to them: Your agencies do wonderful work, but readers want stories about people, so here&#8217;s how to make what you do into a compelling story/photo package. The non-profits responded, and the stories have had new emotional resonance as a result.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The team worked to improve storytelling to help bolster reader engagement and charitable giving during an important time of year. The stories provided a personal face and offered a valuable community service to people throughout the Bay Area. I liked the Mercury News&#8217; presentation and how readers could browse through different stories and causes — a feature I hope is carried over to the East Bay effort at some point to help readers better navigate the many interesting stories and worthy causes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stories created in both Wish Book and Share the Spirit were solid community service journalism, engaging readers to act. In this case, real people were placed upfront on the websites, so readers had a clearer view of where their hard earned money was being used.</p>
<p>The journalists met the challenge of making the project more &#8220;human.&#8221; The 24 stories in the online Wish Book are engaging and easy to use. The group was able to develop an easy-to-use website with information about how and where to make donations. A reader can scroll through information with ease, reading only what is important to them.</p>
<p>The holidays have traditionally been a great time for the community to get involved in community service. All of the information readers need to help is in an easy to follow format. Newspapers have always had holiday giving programs, but this particular package takes full advantage of the fact that readers want information fast and easy to read. Being able to access the information from computers and handheld devices gives it the digital advantage we&#8217;re all striving for at today&#8217;s newspapers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DFMie was awarded for the work Rowlands and Poitinger leading up to the November launch of the charity projects. The winners report that Wish Book has raised $391,000 and Share the Spirit has raised $186,895, though contributions are still being counted. An online donation feature that was new this year raised $15,560 for Share the Spirit, Rowlands reported.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1223" alt="November DFMies Ski" src="../../../../content/uploads/2013/01/November-DFMies-Ski.png" width="768" height="1024" />With some of our newsrooms now getting more mobile traffic than web traffic, it&#8217;s appropriate that one of the November DFMies, for the Colorado/Utah cluster, was produced for use on tablets. Denver Post Director of Newsroom Operations <a title="Linda Shapley" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/linda-shapley/3/b97/291">Linda Shapley</a> explained in her nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Post&#8217;s first e-book for tablet, the <a title="Colorado Ski Guide" href="http://www.denverpost.com/skiguide">Colorado Ski Guide</a> was created by <a title="Steve McMillan" href="https://twitter.com/stevejmcmillan">Steve McMillan</a>, editor for Public Policy/Online Projects, graphic artist <a title="Tom McKay" href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/beyondthedata/author/thomas-mckay/">Tom McKay</a> and lead designer <a title="Jeff Neumann" href="https://twitter.com/NeumannJeff">Jeff Neumann</a>. It incorporates slideshows, interactive graphics and videos.</p>
<p>Although this book shows little advertising, the opportunities for revenue remain strong for the big and small advertiser. There are &#8216;sponsored links&#8217; that can be placed within a section, to actual links from Denver Post content, to interstitials that can be placed as their own separate pages. In addition, the Adobe Digital Publishing technology that was used in its creation will provide analytics that ad reps can take to clients.</p>
<p>All in all, very well put together &#8212; a smart and user friendly offering that can serve as prototype for all their sister news organizations.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge&#8217;s praise:</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought it was a fantastic idea, fantastic use of some of the modern technology available to us and a resource that will be beneficial to both the local community and tourists that come to Colorado.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have chosen the Denver Post’s e-book Colorado Ski Guide for its incorporation of information, pictures, guidance and digital content. The e-book is not only the definitive guide for skiing around the Denver area providing the who, what, when, where and why, but also provides a clean, clear-cut and interactive way to get information.</p>
<p>Each area has its own page that not only includes pictures and information but also drop-down boxes the reader can slide in and out with details such as prices, terrain, hours, resorts and more. Additionally, graphics such as maps and percentage charts have also been incorporated into the pages. Other pages show community hills, local places to get drinks, events, festivals and more.</p>
<p>Not only is this providing a community service by giving readers all the information they need to know, it also might be one of the coolest and easiest ways to navigate that wealth of information.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other Colorado/Utah finalists were David Martinez of the Sterling Journal-Advocate for a story on the <a title="Sterling Journal-Advocate story on marijuana legalization" href="http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_21960208">impact of Colorado&#8217;s legalization of marijuana</a> and The Daily Camera in Boulder Colorado, The Longmont Times-Call and the Colorado Daily for their <a title="Second Story Garage" href="http://secondstorygarage.com/">Second Story Garage</a> music site.</p>
