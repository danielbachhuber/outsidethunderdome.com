		<description><![CDATA[Great post! I want to add that where you post is also important. We&#039;ve seen a lot of success in posting to local Facebook pages and groups that are relevant to the topic we are writing about. For example, one reader has created a Lower Merion Community Network page for residents who live in Lower Merion Township, located just outside Philadelphia. When we post stories to that page about community meetings and other big news, we gather all kinds of comments. One story we posted today drew over 120 comments. On that page, your &quot;be conversational&quot; tip is very important. We don&#039;t want Group members to think we are just looking for page views and so we don&#039;t want to simply post a headline. We actually want to inform and create a conversation around the content we write while gathering reader&#039;s opinions, view points and experiences. Again, great post! Very enlightening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John. We do link to our site on our Facebook page; the weather posts are something we do as community information, without a link, but we link to our stories all the time. In my opinion, having more reach on all posts means when we do link to stories through Facebook, our reach numbers are higher, we are seen in more newsfeeds automatically. Also, I think social media content can be just that sometimes; if someone wakes up every morning, checks their newsfeed, and gets their weather from us every morning, it&#039;s good for our brand image and value.]]></description>
