		<description><![CDATA[Michelle, thanks for your thoughts. You&#039;re right, I shouldn&#039;t have characterized it as a &quot;humiliating competition.&quot; That&#039;s a subjective measure that is up to the entrants to decide, and it&#039;s great that you found value in the contest. If I were able to restate my objection, I&#039;d probably say that I find it distasteful that the company is choosing to dole out professional development via a popularity contest. Ironically, the finalists who were least able to use social media tools to rally support for themselves are the ones who would benefit the most from the conference. But really my point is that you all deserve to go, and given how difficult it is to be a journalist these days, I think your employer owes it to each and every one of you to provide as many learning and growth opportunities as possible. Best of luck in the contest.]]></description>

Needless to say, it was a very awesome response with more than 5,000 votes on the poll, thanks to efforts like yours. And as you can see from the live blog display, dozens and dozens of votes on Twitter too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rod, I respectfully disagree with your comment that the company has created a &quot;humiliating competition.&quot; I see this contest as a way for us to showcase our community engagement, digital storytelling and social media skills as we seek support from our peers and from our audience. What&#039;s great is we can crowdsource support, which can develop deeper bonds with our audience and, as they ask their friends and &quot;followers&quot; to support us, helps us grow our reach and brands as journalists. As part of this contest, I created a gif for the first time. Not only did I get an opportunity to show off my creativity, but I added a digital tool to my tool belt. I also created a meme, and used Tout to showcase ScribbleLive, Storify, uStream and other digital tools I would use while at the conference so that my colleagues could join as a virtual guest. I&#039;ve seen others do the same in this process. This is all great practice for us and it showcases tools other journalists who are following this contest may not know much about and may grab their interest. To that end, I say: &quot;Great idea, Thunderdome, to spur creativity, community engagement and showcase skills.]]></description>
