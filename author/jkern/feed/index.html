Seated: Scott Blanchard, York Daily Record.

(File)" /></p><p dir="ltr">In preparation for the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, five Digital First Media entities — the <a href="http://www.ydr.com/">York Daily Record</a>, the <a href="http://www.eveningsun.com/">Evening Sun</a>, the <a href="http://www.ldnews.com/">Lebanon Daily News</a>, <a href="http://www.publicopiniononline.com/">Public Opinion</a>, and Thunderdome — created a collaborative system to cover the historic event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just as the Iron Brigade constructed a temporary fortification at the end of the first day of fighting, so did the DFM entities, <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/ydrinsider/2013/06/26/the-redoubt-no-doubt-will-aid-gettysburg-150-coverage/">establishing a satellite newsroom </a>near the same site and under the same name: “Redoubt.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was great for Michael Topel, Jason Fields and myself to become better acquainted with a great crew of journalists assembled from DFM properties,” said Thunderdome News Channels Editor, Troy Turner, who provided assistance at Redoubt. “These opportunities to work side-by-side always create better bridges of communication and teamwork, and this was a fun one.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Redoubt was up and running, reporters and photographers worked closely with on-the-ground editors while also maintaining open lines of communication with their respective newsrooms. They also used tools like Google Docs to communicate and worked with an information hub powered by Google Sites that included a master budget and schedules.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We Tweeted. We Touted. We aggregated stories using the likes of Spundge and Rebel Mouse. We deployed about 20 social media tools to push out our coverage,” said Jim McClure, editor of the York Daily Record/Sunday News and east editor for Digital First Media, <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/ydrinsider/2013/07/15/the-redoubt-indeed-aided-gettysburg-150-coverage-no-doubt/">in a post</a> reflecting on the newsrooms’ coverage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">McClure also said this system for collaboration among small and medium-size newsrooms benefited from Digital First Media’s previous experiences in breaking news settings, including the Boston Marathon bombings and Newtown shootings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Newtown, Boston and Gettysburg taught us many lessons about how to immediately mobilize, move, and assign large numbers of journalists equipped with the most up-to-date technology to cover even the toughest of stories,” <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/ydrinsider/2013/07/15/the-redoubt-indeed-aided-gettysburg-150-coverage-no-doubt/">McClure said</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Topel, a Thunderdome editor who was on-site for the Gettysburg coverage, echoed that sentiment, noting how the preparation for Gettysburg will be useful going forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There was a curation team, a social media team, and a plan to get stories up quickly across multiple papers’ websites,” Topel said. “I think the lesson they provide is: use all the preparation time wisely, because then you can figure out best practices to put in play when a big story suddenly breaks and there is no preparation time.”</p>

(Julia Kern/Thunderdome)" /></p><p>Last month, a group of journalists convened at Digital First Media headquarters in New York City to judge nominees for the the first annual DMFies, which will recognize the best DFM journalism of 2012.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2012/11/29/inaugural-winners-dfmies-editorial-awards/" target="_blank">inaugural awards</a> were distributed last October, the monthly DFMies have rewarded journalists who produce excellent work in various categories. This is the first time the DFMies have been based on a year&#8217;s worth of work.</p>
<p>The DFMies will choose a DFM Journalist of the Year in four national groupings: non-daily, small daily (under 10,000 print circulation), mid-sized daily (10-50,000) and metro (over 50,000). Each DFMie will also be accompanied by a $1,000 award.</p>
<p>DFMies will also be awarded to winners in various categories, including coverage of breaking news (staff award), investigative/enterprise reporting, visual journalism, design, sports journalism, feature/lifestyle/entertainment journalism, opinion journalism, interactive journalism, data journalism, opinion journalism, live coverage, use of social media, community engagement project, and staff blogger.</p>
<p>Judges evaluated each journalist’s work based on four criteria: journalism, digital skills, community engagement and community service.</p>
<p>To determine the winners, each judge read entries in a certain field and selected three finalists from within that field, also noting a first place selection. If the second judge with whom the first was paired agreed with the choice, the two would write a comment about why they agreed. If the second judge didn&#8217;t agree with the first, the two would have a discussion about their choices, which either led to an agreement or the need for a third judge to come in and help reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The judges included Jay Rosen, Ju-Don Roberts, Daniel Victor, Jennifer Gaie Hellum, Craig Kanalley, Lena Groeger, Jason Fry, Eric Carvin, Rose Eveleth, Hal Straus, Katharine Zaleski, Robin Lloyd and Mitra Kalita.</p>
<p>The winners will be announced later this morning and recognized at a banquet held in Denver in July. Read more about the first annual DFMies <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/02/21/announcing-annual-dfmie-awards/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Thunderdome intern Julia Kern comes from Penn State University, where she was the student newspaper's first social media manager]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/julia-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Julia Kern poses in front of the Nittany Lion Shrine at Penn State University, where she works for the student newspaper. Julia is one of two interns joining Thunderdome for the summer. (Personal file)" /></p><p>My name is Julia Kern, and it&#8217;s a pleasure to be introducing myself as one of two summer interns at Digital First Media&#8217;s Project Thunderdome.</p>
<p>As a rising senior at Penn State majoring in print journalism, I’ve received fairly traditional journalism training, taking classes in news writing, copy editing and page design. At the Daily Collegian, Penn State’s student newspaper, I began as a traditional beat reporter, covering the Penn State administration and its Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>But I also have extensive experience with social media, and have seen how a developed digital presence can expand a local newsroom’s reach. At the Daily Collegian, I was the paper&#8217;s first social media manager, a position conceived only a few weeks before the firing and death of longtime football coach Joe Paterno, ensuing &#8220;riots&#8221; and NCAA sanctions. I was the primary person heading up the paper&#8217;s social media efforts during that time, which meant that I used social platforms like Twitter and Facebook to provide real-time, around-the-clock coverage to thousands of people both locally and nationally. Needless to say, I had a busy sophomore year.</p>
<p>Because of my solid foundation in traditional journalism and experience with new tools, I&#8217;m excited to be working with an organization that aims to support local news and move it forward digitally. I&#8217;ve become familiar with some of the constraints inherent to local news and am excited to be working with an organization that understands those constraints and looks to alleviate the stresses that prevent local newsrooms from doing what they do best.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to a great summer!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/group-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Teams had 30 minutes to prototype before they shared their early concepts." /></p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/06/07/affordable-understandable-hmw-users-navigate-obamacare/#gallery-3004-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>
<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3024" alt="HMW" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/HMW-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" />This week, a team from all departments within Thunderdome spent the day at an offsite brainstorming session. The question was simple: how might we inform our readers how they will be affected by the Affordable Care Act and what they need to do. The guidance was simple, too: think big, support each others’ ideas and focus on the users.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/lcochran/" target="_blank">Laura Cochran</a> began the day by asking everyone to take five minutes to design a cereal box toy for “children,” noting that the “children” included the President of the United States, a magician, a superhero and an emergency room nurse. The responses ranged from a list of questions (“What do you mean by design?”) to a small figurine made out of pipe cleaners. Each person who wrote something or made a list paired up with someone who drew or created something, such that the left and right-brained Thunderdomers were sufficiently mixed.</p>
<p>The pairs proceeded to brainstorm different ways of reaching our audience, as Laura urged us to think big and move quickly. At peak brainstorming, we were scribbling so fast on Post-it pads that I had barely finished writing “Tout video stream” before my teammate <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/mgrisafi/" target="_blank">Matt Grisafi</a>, Health and Food Channel Manager, was putting a Post-it showing “Q&amp;As with doctors” onto the wall.</p>
<p>After brainstorming and clustering common ideas each team chose features to include in their storytelling platform. My group designed a website with various tiles that allowed readers to choose information pertaining to them, connect with others who had similar concerns and save information to read later, among other features.</p>
<p>The interesting thing was, despite the diverse makeup of the teams and Laura’s encouragement to think outside the box, there were distinct common threads in all three groups’ ideas. All were desktop sites with the option to work on mobile, all were visually oriented and all were capable of allowing the user to receive information tailored to his or her personal health needs. It was interesting to see how many Thunderdome team members had similar conceptions of what the Digital First Media user might be most receptive to.</p>
<p>That being said, there was one outlier: the group that put its creative juices to work by combining those features in the form of a digital board game mirroring the plot of the popular HBO show “Game of Thrones.” What better way to find information pertaining to healthcare concerns than to have each concern correspond with one of the seven kingdoms?</p>
