These tech trends can make a difference now. (Thinkstock)" /></p><p><em><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4832" alt="amy_webb" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/amy_webb.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a>Editor’s note: This is the seventh in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/amy-webb">Amy Webb</a>’s &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/10-tech-trends/#.UncxShXn-mQ">10 Tech Trends for Journalists</a>&#8220; was one of the most fascinating (and entertaining) of the ONA 13 conference (<a href="http://www.webbmediagroup.com/ona2013" target="_blank">see the slides</a> and <a href="http://www.livestream.com/ona13/video?clipId=pla_18b4730d-fccc-45db-bebd-29c85a86a226" target="_blank">video</a>).</p>
<p>From a demo of MindMeld anticipatory computing to a live drone flight it was an exciting glimpse at the future by the digital futurist. But I left the session thinking, how could this possibly relate to my newsroom right now? We’re barely keeping up with today’s technology, and now we’re supposed to be using Google Glass, talking to virtual personal assistants and learning how to fly drones? I decided to pick four topics, explore them a little more and think of some ways our resources could be applied toward these future trends.</p>
<h1><b>Trend 1: Smart virtual personal assistants (SVPAs)<br />
</b></h1>
<p>The second trend Webb talked about was &#8220;smart virtual personal assistants&#8221; like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/donna-manage-your-day/id617548142">Donna</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osito/id617172452?mt=8">Osito</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tempo-smart-calendar-free/id593819390">Tempo</a> and <a href="https://www.cueup.com/">Cue</a>. Basically, these apps scrape the calendars, contacts lists, social media and email on your phone and combine that data with real-time weather and traffic information to help organize your day. Webb said SVPAs have become a $400 million market(!) in the past 12 months.</p>
<div id="attachment_4826" style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4826  " alt="Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times' info on Election Day?" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/donna_photo.jpg" width="307" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Donna app. Where is the El Paso Times&#8217; info on Election Day?</p></div>
<p>How can news organizations get into the action? This got me thinking. How does news consumption fit into a person’s daily habits? Here is a very rough estimation of a local person&#8217;s routine in El Paso, Tex.</p>
<p><em><strong>Morning</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skim headlines to see if anything big happened overnight and to see what will happen today.</li>
<li>Check the weather so I know how to dress for the day.</li>
<li>Listen to the radio to learn about any traffic accidents or closures that I should avoid on my commute to work.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>At work</strong>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Possibly do some research on <a href="http://elpasotime.com" target="_blank">elpasotimes.com</a> if my job involves local people and businesses.</li>
<li>If I travel for work, I need continued updates on traffic and weather.</li>
<li>If breaking news happens during the day, I want to be alerted to it and will follow updates from my phone.</li>
<li>May make plans for evening and weekend activities. Look up information on events, restaurants and venues.</li>
<li>Will check for more traffic and weather updates before leaving the office.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Evening</strong>:</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Scan the headlines from the day. May spend some time reading longer features or watching short videos online before bed.</li>
<li>May take a look at my schedule for tomorrow or later in the week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if we got our news from SVPAs?</strong><br />
It seems like SVPAs (at least the ones I looked at) don&#8217;t account for news at this point, which seems like an unfortunate gap (or a great opportunity). What would an SVPA look like if it incorporated content from your local news organization? Take a short trip with me into the future:</p>
<p>In addition to my scheduled events, contacts and social media, the SVPA could include helpful nuggets of &#8220;news I can use.&#8221; In the morning, I would get the latest traffic and weather information and a short news briefing (in text or audio form, depending on my preference).</p>
<p>In the event of breaking news, I&#8217;d get an alert and short updates on how this developing story may affect me. How do I avoid the traffic mess caused by an accident or crime scene? When do I pick up my child in a lockdown situation? Such an app could also link me directly to the El Paso TImes&#8217; social media channels.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Our news and event calendars would also be a great asset for an SVPA. If I&#8217;m reading about an event on elpasotimes.com or on our mobile app, I could save it to my calendar so all the info about the event would automatically populate in the SVPA. Or I could program it to include a series of events, like all UTEP football home games, or all El Paso Symphony Orchestra concerts. Besides the basic &#8220;if you go&#8221; information, the event information could include links to related articles, such as game UTEP game previews, or a review of a play I’m going to.</span></p>
<p>The personalization of these apps make them ideal tools to send me articles I really want to read. Is there a local news topic I’m continually interested in? Is there news about my neighborhood? The app could personally deliver these articles right to my phone as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>Obviously, a lot of work would need to go into restructuring the data of our content and calendars to communicate with such an app. But something like this would definitely make local news a more integrated part of a person&#8217;s day, giving them personalized information as they need it, when they want it.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 2: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>This trend surprised me at first, but after a few slides the connection to journalists seemed obvious to me.</p>
<p>There is typically a low barrier to entry for MOOCs and many are offered for free and with no commitment to continue. Webb called this trend &#8220;snackable&#8221; learning. She said Millennials are particularly fond of MOOCs and referred to them as &#8220;addictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some examples of MOOCs are <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (math and science courses offered free online, with partnerships from some organizations, <a href="http://curious.com">Curious.com</a> (how-to videos on a variety of subjects, some offered for free) and <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> (courses in web development, business fundamentals, product management, etc.). Webb seemed to think there was a good opportunity for partnership with MOOCs like these.</p>
<p>One of Webb’s key points was that a MOOC leverages something you are doing anyway, but packages<strong> </strong>it in a different way. I think she’s right — it’s time for us to get creative about packaging the content we are producing. I also think it would be great to leverage our newsroom&#8217;s talents and interests in a way other than having them write a blog or column.</p>
<p>These are the five types of MOOCs for newsrooms that Webb suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking news analysis cheat sheet</li>
<li>Authentic how-to video</li>
<li>1-minute explainer video</li>
<li>Staff round up</li>
<li>Quiz</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few ideas I had for each of those that I think readers might be interested in. These are localized to El Paso, but could easily be adapted to any locale:</p>
<p><strong>Breaking news analysis cheat sheets</strong> (see The Washington Post’s great <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/29/9-questions-about-syria-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask/">9 things about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining the Mexican drug war</li>
<li>A quick history of El Paso</li>
<li>School cheating investigations in El Paso County</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How-to videos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to make pumpkin tortilla soup</li>
<li>How to plant a vegetable garden in the desert</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also produce how-to videos that help readers contribute their own content</p>
<ul>
<li>How to write an obituary</li>
<li>How to write a classified ad that will get noticed</li>
<li>How to record a professional looking video with your smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1-minute explainer video</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The building of El Paso’s new baseball stadium</li>
<li>How did the Asarco smokestacks get demolished?</li>
<li>Why is global climate change happening?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Staff roundup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Book of the month by a local author from our book page editor</li>
<li>5 can’t miss things to do in El Paso this weekend from our entertainment editor</li>
<li>5 best sports tweets this week</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quiz</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What happened in El Paso this week? 10-question quiz</li>
<li>How well do you know El Paso? 100-question quiz with prizes</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Beyond those, it would be interesting to explore a long-form course on a subject of interest to our readers that would keep them coming back, week after week, familiarizing them with our newsroom. For example, we could do a 10-part El Paso history series with our staff librarian. </span></p>
<h1><strong>Trend 3: Comments<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Webb also had some interesting things to say about the future of reader comments on news sites. She says, as they exist today, comments are not adding value to our product and are a distraction, and gave some horrifying examples to prove her point.</p>
<p>To remedy this, she suggested that news organizations create comment systems that are similar to a cocktail party — only include comments from people that I know or &#8220;find fascinating,&#8221; with the ability to invite others into the conversation.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/LittleGuyInATie" target="_blank">Lucas</a> and I had a discussion about this after the talk. He said, &#8220;Wouldn’t it get boring after awhile, to hear the same old voices in the comment forum?&#8221; I disagreed, thinking commenting on our site could benefit from some curation. Friends and &#8220;top commenters&#8221; could move to the top, with all others after that. Our conversation was a reminder that different people want different things from comments, and it&#8217;s hard to make one system that fits them all.</p>
<p>I checked out a few of the sites that Webb mentioned to see what the cutting edge of commenting technology looks like. <a href="http://gawker.com">Gawker</a> makes you create a <a href="http://kinja.com/" target="_blank">Kinja</a> account (and therefore, a blog) in order for you to comment. They also <a href="http://gawker.com/crime-in-the-hamptons-is-exactly-like-youd-expect-1457278259">inform you when the author of the article is participating</a> (a great idea, I thought). <a href="http://qz.com/">Quartz</a> allows you to annotate in the margins of an article. I was impressed at the look of it, though I wonder if it is too much work for the average reader to click on each paragraph rather than just see all the comments at one glance. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> has three comment views – All, Reader Picks and NYT picks. Though not in Webb&#8217;s presentation, I also took a look at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post</a>, where a &#8220;Community Pundits&#8221; comment appears at the top of the comments section. After that you can choose between Highlighted, Most Recent, Oldest and Most Faved comment views.</p>
<p>My dream comment looks like this (click photo to enlarge):<br />
<a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4828" alt="comment_system" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/comment_system.jpg" width="1134" height="642" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You must sign in, preferably with a social media account tied to your real name. No anonymous commenting.</li>
<li>Readers can comment anywhere in the article, including at the end if they want to write something long.</li>
<li>Readers would have the option to view comments, or not, through options on a floating toolbar on the side of the page. (I’m envisioning something like VH1’s old <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156226/" target="_blank">Pop Up Videos</a> as what the comments might look like.)</li>
<li>Comments from my friends on social media, most popular commenters and the author of the post are color-coded and you could choose to view only those comments if you wish.</li>
<li>A sophisticated algorithm sorts all this out and a real person does not make a full-time job out of filtering comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know, it’s a lot to ask. I think comment forums are one of the trickiest aspects of our site to manage. How do we encourage comments that are fun and insightful that will enhance readers&#8217; engagement with our content? On the other hand, how do we make it so that comments are not a distraction from the content itself? And how do we keep all those trolls away? It&#8217;s a delicate balance and I think more experimentation is a great trend.</p>
<p>Zack Harold recently wrote about <a title="Want to improve your online comments? Don’t feed the trolls" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/11/05/improve-online-comments-feed-trolls/" target="_blank">how to deal with online trolls</a> from a different ONA13 session.</p>
<h1><strong>Trend 4: Data<br />
</strong></h1>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Webb says 2014 is the year data goes completely mainstream. She said everyone in the newsroom needs to get experience with data, now.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately she didn’t get to spend too much time on this. But she is right.</p>
<p>Data was a <em>HUGE</em> topic at ONA13. Here are some of the sessions that focused on data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/closing-the-digital-and-data-divide/#.UnfPNETPdJ8">Closing the Digital and Data Divide: Data Journalism in Developing Countries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">Storytelling with Data</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/storytelling-with-data/">I Need Data for My Story. Help.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/tower-of-babel-problem/">Data Journalism: The Tower of Babel Problem</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/your-datas-showing/#.UnfPr0TPdJ8">&#8220;Ha, Your Data&#8217;s Showing&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Big Data, Little Newsroom</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnfQOETPdJ8">Building Your First Data Driven Map with Tile Mill</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/friday-lunch-keynote/#.UnfP30TPdJ8">ONA13 keynote</a> was delivered by Nate Silver of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">fivethirtyeight.com</a>.</p>
<p>So, what needs to happen for newsrooms to fully embrace data journalism?</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two different classes of people in a newsroom and both of them need help:</p>
<p>First, we need to bring people who don’t usually deal with data visualization into the fold and get them to think in a &#8220;data&#8221; mindset. We need to fundamentally rewire the way journalists think about their stories. Data is an integral way of telling a story, especially in a digital format. Many journalists still aren&#8217;t getting it.</p>
<p>But I would argue that the most skilled of the data journalists in smaller newsrooms face a whole slew of problems, too. How many of us are trained statisticians? How do we know how to &#8220;clean&#8221; data and interpret it correctly? How many of us are experienced at coding? One of the biggest obstacles we face is that we lack the manpower to take on big projects. <a href="https://github.com/DFMdata?tab=members" target="_blank">DFM’s data team</a> is a great idea in this respect. They provide professional help for the more ambitious projects we want to take on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting journey digging into just a few technology trends that Webb identified in her crystal ball (I&#8217;m still pondering Google Glass and drones). Webb is someone I&#8217;m definitely going to keep an eye on in the next few years (on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/WebbMedia">@WebbMedia</a>). Who can say which of her trends will end up being &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; but we&#8217;re sure to hear more about everything she talked about.</p>
<p>The unknown can be scary but I&#8217;m also excited about the possibilities for the future of journalism.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Professor Jeremy Caplan’s presentation at ONA13, 21 Ways to Awesome-ize Your Mobile Toolkit, had Annette Arrigucci of the El Paso Times ooh-ing and aah-ing over new apps to try. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/videolicious-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="videolicious" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the third in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program. </em></p>
<p>Professor Jeremy Caplan’s presentation at ONA13, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qxs7QHU16YQT2nOsh4Cm3q6NOZDn4fZelAI2I28FV0E/edit" target="_blank">21 Ways to Awesome-ize Your Mobile Toolkit</a>, had me ooh-ing and aah-ing over new apps to try. In his presentation, Caplan advised us to “Pick. Stick. Dig.” with apps, meaning don’t just download a bunch of apps for the sake of having them, but choose a few you will use and dig into the features. In keeping with that, here are my experiences with seven of the apps Caplan talked about.</p>
<h1><strong>1: <a href="http://campl.us/">Camera+</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: A photo app with many useful features.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $1.99 in App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: The app allows you a plethora of options to adjust photos after they are taken. Choose from a variety of “scene” adjustments – Clarity, Auto, Flash, Backlit, Darken, Cloudy, Shade, etc. You can tilt or flip the photo and choose from a variety of crop options. You can also add filters and a variety of borders.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a photo I adjusted with Camera+:</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Baseball stadium going up: <a href="http://t.co/KMnufniZsV">pic.twitter.com/KMnufniZsV</a></p>
<p>— Annette Arrigucci (@elpasoanne) <a href="https://twitter.com/elpasoanne/statuses/394139086157406208">October 26, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>After:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Here is stadium construction photo edited with Camera+ <a href="http://t.co/4vTZoMYJbO">pic.twitter.com/4vTZoMYJbO</a></p>
<p>— Annette Arrigucci (@elpasoanne) <a href="https://twitter.com/elpasoanne/statuses/394142111982825473">October 26, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Camera+ also allows you to square crop or use Stabilizer, Timer and Burst modes if you are shooting a photo within the app.</p>
<p>You can quickly view the photos you took or modified within the app in your Lightbox. Metadata has a cool map showing where you took the photo and other technical specs about it. You have the option to save this to your camera roll, email, share to social media or delete it.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>The verdict</strong>: This seems like a must-have tool for photographers who are taking many photos and need to edit them quickly. For shooting inside the app, Timer and Burst mode work great. However, it may be a little too much for reporters. The iPhone&#8217;s standard photos app offers quick adjustments that are similar to what is included here.</span></p>
<h1>2. <a href="http://joby.com/gorillacam" target="_blank">GorillaCam</a></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: An app for shooting time-lapse and stop-motion videos.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free in App Store; Pro version available for $1.99</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: On GorillaCam you can choose between stop motion, time-lapse and camera modes.</p>
<p>I tried the stop motion feature with 10 shots. It worked for editing the shots together into a video, but the free version did not give me the option to control the video length, so it was very difficult to see each shot. With the free version, it seems like you would need to take a lot of shots (maybe 50 to 100) to make the video comprehensible. If you are interested in this feature it’s worth upgrading to the paid version.</p>
<p>The time-lapse feature is more promising because you can control the length of timelapse and the length of the video. I chose a capture time of 10 minutes and a playback time of 10 seconds. The app took 240 frames to make the 10-second video. The video was automatically added to my camera roll. The only drawback I found is that you definitely need a stable place to set up the iPhone. The Gorilla Cam app <a href="http://joby.com/gorillapod" target="_blank">advertises a GorillaPod stand</a> and I can see why. Lacking that, I set up books and boxes to prop the iPhone up to make a video of my fish tank.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/q5Qn5jaxLBI" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Camera mode has settings for a timer, burst mode and anti-shake.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Time-lapse feature is fantastic, though you may need some equipment to stabilize the camera. Upgrade to pro for stop motion.</p>
<h1><strong>3: <a href="http://photosynth.net/">PhotoSynth</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Easy way to shoot wraparound panoramas and publish them.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free on App Store</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>My experience</strong>: It took me a few tries to get used to shooting the panoramic photo; there are no tips for shooting on the help document. You have to be very steady and move the camera very slowly. I took three shots going top to bottom in one spot before moving the camera to the left. One helpful aspect is you can see how it is going to look as you are shooting it.</span></p>
<p>The final product looks amazing. You can spin around in 360 degrees, move up, move down, zoom in, zoom out. Be aware that a few minor imperfections show up, especially if you are shooting anything with sharp lines.</p>

<p>Sharing the final product requires you to sign in with a Microsoft account (or sign up for one). You also must put the panorama on your account on the <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=8964b7aa-4ea7-4b81-b36e-6b04dc06c9e5" target="_blank">PhotoSynth website</a> to be able to view it through the PhotoSynth viewer on a desktop. You do have the option to make it unlisted. You can embed the panorama in an article or on a blog, as I did here.</p>
<p>Deleting a synth is tricky. You can delete it before PhotoSynth makes a panorama out of it. After that you must delete it using your account on the Photosynth website.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: The final product will “wow” readers. Sign-in requirement is mildly annoying and the help documentation could use some additional tips on shooting.</p>
<h1><strong>4: <a href="http://cinemagr.am/">Cinemagram</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Create animated-gif style short videos easily.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free on App Store</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>My experience</strong>: You must sign in to Twitter, Facebook or register for an account to use Cinemagram. Cinemagram is a network where others can view your Cines. There is a very short, helpful tutorial on how to use Cinemagram.</span></p>
<p>To record you hold down the record button for as long or short as you like and Cinemagram stitches them together into a video that is up to four seconds long. You also have the option to import video or photos from your camera roll.</p>
<p>If you enable the microphone, sound is automatically recorded with each video. Before you post the Cine, you have the option to turn off the sound. (This is a good idea because the sound goes on auto-play as soon as you open it and can get very annoying.) You can also apply filters to your Cines, similar to Instagram.</p>
<p>Here are two Cines I made:</p>
<p><iframe id="cinemagram" style="postion: absolute; left: 0px; width: 100%; top: 0px; height: 100%;" src="http://cinemagr.am/embed/156853229" height="480" width="360" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe id="cinemagram" style="postion: absolute; left: 0px; width: 100%; top: 0px; height: 100%;" src="http://cinemagr.am/embed/156855973" height="480" width="360" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>If you signed in with Twitter, watch out because automatic sharing to Twitter is enabled by default so when you post a new video it will automatically tweet it to your followers.</p>
<p>It is not very intuitive to find the delete button on a Cine. You need to go to your profile and click the … button on the Cine you want to delete. Also, the FAQ says you can make a Cine private; however, I could not find the option for it.</p>
<p>The videos were viewable on Firefox and Chrome, but I could not see them on IE 10. There is an option to embed them in articles and blog posts.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Very easy and fun to create Cines, though it could take some time to do it well enough to stand out in a crowd. The privacy concerns are also an issue – make sure you save only finished products. Options for short videos in hard news stories may be limited, but it might be a fun promo for a special feature. And we get more screen time and similar functionality with <a href="http://www.tout.com/" target="_blank">Tout</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://vine.co/" target="_blank">Vine</a>.</p>
<h1><strong>5: <a href="http://madewithover.com/">Over</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Layer text over a photo.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $1.99 on App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: You can take a photo with the app or select one from your album, then add text or artwork (must login or signup to use artwork). It’s extremely easy to add text with a variety of font or colors and drag the text anywhere on the photo you would like. Edit the size, opacity, position, alignment, character spacing or line height of the text. You can also crop the photo to a square and adjust the tint on the photo. There are about 30 creative-looking fonts to choose from. You must “unlock” others.</p>
<p>Here are a couple I made:</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ona.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4761" alt="ona" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ona-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ready_to_blog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4762" alt="ready_to_blog" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/ready_to_blog-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Once you’re done you can save the photo to your camera roll or share on Facebook, Twitter, Path, Instagram, Message or Email. There are many great examples on Instagram.</p>
<p>One minor confusion was the “Reset” option. Reset starts you over from scratch with a new photo.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Very easy to use with elegant results. Love the design of this app.</p>
<h1><strong>6: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/soundcloud/id336353151">SoundCloud</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Record and edit audio.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free on App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: You must sign in with Google+, Facebook or create a SoundCloud account. Oddly, there is no “Record” button on the bottom bar. The Record button appears the first time you hit the “You” button. It also shows on the “Activity” button.</p>
<p>Tap the big red “record” button to start recording. You can stop and resume recording as much as you want. To edit, tap the scissors button to the right of the record button. Unfortunately you can only cut from beginning or end. If you want to edit out a part in the middle of the recording, you will need use a more advanced audio editor on your computer or re-record the audio from the Soundcloud app. Although, one nice feature is that you can begin recording again from the end point you trimmed. You can save or delete the audio file after editing.</p>
<p>If you save you can make the recording public or private. It automatically appears in your SoundCloud account. You can share it to Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or email.</p>
<p>You can access your recording on SoundCloud.com. Here you can download the audio file or share your recording via a link or embed. Free accounts are limited to two hours of audio, but you can delete older files to make space.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117541449" height="166" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: Good quality audio for up-close recording, such as a podcast. You would have to test this app in different environments. Not sure if it works well in a large public place, i.e. to record a speech. The in-app editing tool is a little clunky, but you can download the file and use another tool to edit if necessary. Ability to embed or link the audio in a story is fantastic and opens up many possibilities for interactive articles.</p>
<h1><strong>7: <a href="https://videolicious.com/">Videolicious</a></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Quickly create a video with voiceover and/or music.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Free in App Store</p>
<p><strong>My experience</strong>: Videolicious offers a short tutorial on how to use the app, which is helpful since it’s a little complex. You begin by choosing video clips from your camera roll, which show as thumbnails on the right side of the screen. Then you can begin recording your own voiceover with the clips as B-roll. This may look a little weird as it shows you recording yourself, but you can strip the video of yourself in the final product.</p>
<p>You can choose when you want the clip to transition to the next by clicking on a thumbnail. Unfortunately, you must record the entire narration all at once. You cannot stop and start the recording whenever you want. When you stop recording you can review the video and either delete or save it.</p>
<p>You can also choose music from the app to go with your narration. There are several styles of music to choose from (and even more if you upgrade to a pro account). The music didn’t sound bad with my narration, but in the end I decided to skip it.</p>
<p>After that, the app asks what quality you want for the video (SD or HD). You can share to email, Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. The video will process and then it will upload. Upload time is a bit long and it’s recommended that you stay in the app the entire time. The video is also saved to your camera roll.</p>
<p>I emailed the video to myself and was able to play the video within the email or on the Videolicious site. However, it would not allow me to embed it on an outside site. I had to share it to my YouTube account to get the option to embed.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ep0eQps0INk" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: This is an easy way to make short, professional-looking videos with narration from your phone. The main downside is that it is annoying to have to record the narration all at once and have to start over if you make a mistake. I would choose this over iMovie for short projects. For longer ones, I would go with iMovie because it has more features.</p>
