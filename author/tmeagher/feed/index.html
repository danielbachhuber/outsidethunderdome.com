<div id="attachment_3177" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/MaryJo-Webster.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3177 " alt="MaryJo Webster" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/MaryJo-Webster.jpg" width="245" height="346" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">MaryJo Webster</p></div>
<p>An exceptionally talented and experienced analytic and investigative journalist, MaryJo will bring a critical new dimension to the data team. She will be charged with spearheading national data reporting projects for the DFM network, as well as leading a more in-depth training effort. She will also be able to guide data analysis projects that originate within Thunderdome.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with MaryJo&#8217;s work, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maryjo-webster/6/370/273" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a little bit of background</a>. She has been the computer-assisted reporting editor at the Pioneer Press since 2005. Her work there has earned a handful of awards, including the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/pioneer-press-examination-public-pension-spiking-wins-investigative-journalism-dfmie/" target="_blank">2012 investigative journalism DFMie</a>. She also teaches a data reporting class at the University of Minnesota. Previously, she worked as the sports database editor at USA Today, the database editor at The Center for Public Integrity and the data library manager at Investigative Reporters and Editors.</p>
<p>MaryJo started her career as a reporter and, later, assistant city editor, at small newspapers in New Ulm, Minn. and Oshkosh, Wis. She holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and a master&#8217;s degree in journalism from the University of Missouri-Columbia. She and her husband, Jamey, live in Arden Hills, Minn., with their 5-year-old twins, Benjamin and Madeline.</p>
<p>MaryJo, who will work from her home in Minnesota, officially starts with us on Feb. 3, although she&#8217;ll spend the coming weeks wrapping up projects for the Pioneer Press and gradually transitioning to our team.</p>
<p>Please welcome MaryJo to our team.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that our Digital First Represents contestants have completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we're ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents #NICAR14 contest.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p>In September, <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/09/30/nicar14-digital-first-represents/">we kicked off our contest</a> to send three journalists from Digital First Media papers to learn data journalism skills from the best in the business at Investigative Reporters and Editors&#8217; <a title="NICAR 14" href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/" target="_blank">2014 Computer-Assisted Reporting conference</a> in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Today, after our contestants completed dozens of online classes and pitched the investigative projects they hope to pursue, we&#8217;re ready to announce the winners of our Digital First Represents <a title="#NICAR14 on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nicar14" target="_blank">#NICAR14</a> contest.</p>
<p>We received 18 entries from reporters and editors in every cluster of the company. From the Los Angeles Area News Group to New England, enterprising journalists with great ideas threw their hats into the ring.</p>
<p>We expected a lot from the folks who entered this contest. We asked them to jump through hoops that would introduce them to some of the training and support that our company and other journalism organizations can offer.</p>
<p><strong>1. They all had to join our data journalism discussion group</strong>, which now numbers more than 100 members from every DFM state and cluster. (If you&#8217;d like to join the conversation, email data editor Tom Meagher at <a href="mailto: tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">tmeagher@digitalfirstmedia.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>2. Everyone had to complete at least one online class in data journalism</strong>. Many took more than one class. For some, it was an afternoon of <a title="CartoDB Academy" href="http://cartodb.com/academy" target="_blank">interactive mapping with CartoDB</a>. For others, it was a weeks-long <a title="Udacity statistics" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/st101" target="_blank">statistics class from Udacity</a> or an <a title="Introduction to databases" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/db" target="_blank">introduction to databases on Coursera</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. For our judges, though, the most important requirement was that every entrant had to pitch a project</strong> they want to pursue with the skills they hope to learn at NICAR. Because the stories haven&#8217;t run yet, we can&#8217;t tell you too much about the winners&#8217; projects, but rest assured, they will chronicle their reporting process here on InsideThunderdome as their projects develop.</p>
<p>Enough throat clearing. You&#8217;re probably only reading this to find out who won the contest. So who did we decide on? Without further adieu&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Lindsey-Anderson.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6016 alignleft" alt="Lindsey Anderson, Las Cruces Sun-News" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Lindsey-Anderson-150x150.jpg" width="105" height="105" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/L_M_Anderson" target="_blank">Lindsey Anderson</a> </strong>is an education and border reporter at the <a title="Las Cruces Sun-News" href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/" target="_blank">Las Cruces Sun-News</a>. Her favorite stories to cover include issues kids face in southern New Mexico, from teen pregnancy to educational disparities. She graduated from American University in 2012 and has a very expensive travel addiction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/adkins.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-6015 alignright" alt="Sean Adkins, York Daily Record" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/adkins.jpeg" width="77" height="115" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/sadkins75" target="_blank">Sean Adkins</a></strong> is a business reporter with the <a title="York Daily Record" href="http://www.ydr.com/" target="_blank">York Daily Record</a>/Sunday News. Since joining the Daily Record in 2000, he has covered the utility industry, including Three Mile Island and Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, real estate, retail and tourism. His digital and print beat reporting and investigative work has won several awards from the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association.</p>
<p><strong><img class="wp-image-6017 alignleft" alt="Jason Hoppin, Santa Cruz Sentinel" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/photo-11-e1387557418744-150x150.jpg" width="105" height="105" /><a href="https://twitter.com/scnewsdude" target="_blank">Jason Hoppin</a></strong> is a reporter at the <a title="Santa Cruz Sentinel" href="http://santacruzsentinel.com/" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a>, covering the county and the environment in his hometown. Formerly at American Lawyer Media and the <a title="TwinCities.com" href="http://www.twincities.com/" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>, he has covered a number of beats in his career, including crime, state and federal courts, health care, politics and government at all levels. (And he still wants to try his hand at sports).</p>
<p>The winners were selected by our panel of judges, which included data editor <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/" target="_blank">Tom Meagher</a>, interactives editor <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins/" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a> and St. Paul Pioneer Press database editor <a title="MaryJo Webster on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mndatamine" target="_blank">MaryJo Webster</a>.</p>
<p>For each of the winners, Digital First Media will pay for the #NICAR14 conference registration and lodging. They (or their newsrooms) have to foot the bill for their travel to Baltimore. In return, the winners have some responsibilities. They will tweet several of the conference sessions. They will write about what they learn at NICAR14 for InsideThunderdome.com. They&#8217;ll also go back to their newsrooms and share their newfound knowledge.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the winners will put their new data skills to immediate use as they pursue significant, data-driven investigative projects in their newsrooms. After those stories run, they&#8217;ll show their work by writing about how they did it for InsideThunderdome.com.</p>
<p>NICAR 14 will be an incredible learning opportunity for these three DFM journalists. It&#8217;s regrettable that we can&#8217;t send more of our colleagues with great data reporting projects in the works as well. But we are confident that we count on Lindsey, Sean and Jason to channel their experience into some really compelling work that we can all learn from.</p>
<p><em>Digital First Media journalists who plan to attend NICAR 14 through other means, leave a comment on this post with your Twitter handle so we can add you to our <a href="https://twitter.com/DFMThunderdome/lists/dfm-staff-at-nicar14" target="_blank">DFM staff at NICAR14 Twitter list</a>. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dfmrepsnicar620x400-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmrepsnicar620x400" /></p><p>Every winter, hundreds of data journalists gather to share ideas, stories and techniques from the bleeding edge of investigative reporting, data visualization and the development of news applications. Those who attend Investigative Reporters and Editors&#8217; annual Computer-Assisted Reporting conference include the brightest and most generous minds pursuing data journalism for the best news organizations in the world.</p>
<p>This winter, you have a chance to represent your Digital First newsroom and join them in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Ask any journalist who has attended the conference (colloquially referred to as NICAR, for the National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting, a part of IRE), and she or he will tell you the experience has proven invaluable year after year. But no matter how much you want to learn a difficult new skill, like SQL or web scraping, paying to get to a conference can be another challenge altogether.</p>
<p>With that economic reality in mind, over the summer, we created the Digital First Represents program to send journalists from our newsrooms to high-value conferences to learn and share knowledge. We are sending five journalists from across the country to <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/">ONA13 in Atlanta</a> in a few weeks and <a title="Design on the mind? DFM wants you for SND" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/09/26/dfm-represents-snd-workshop/">two more to SND in Louisville</a>. And now we want to choose three more from three different newsrooms to go to NICAR. These three will be awarded with registration to NICAR14 and hotel lodging during the conference in Baltimore, Feb. 27 to March 2.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not just looking for people who want to go and eat crabs and pit beef and drink Natty Boh. We&#8217;ll consider people of any experience or skill level who are eager to learn. We want to send people who want to participate in the DFM data journalism community. We want to help our journalists who are desperately trying to learn specific skills or pursue stories that could benefit from the wisdom and training they&#8217;d receive at NICAR. Each entrant in the contest will pitch a data-driven project that they will complete and publish after the conference, using techniques they learn in Baltimore.</p>
<p>We want people who recognize the value of strong, investigative journalism and the smart use of data in reporting and who will share what they learn with their colleagues. We are looking for ambassadors who can bottle up the tips and excitement at NICAR and bring that back to their newsrooms. Each of our three winners will be expected to live tweet at least two NICAR session and to contribute at least two blog posts here on InsideThunderdome.com about what they learned at the conference.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT NICAR14</strong><br />
NICAR14 will take place at the Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards, from Feb. 27 to March 2, 2014. For more information, check out <a href="http://www.ire.org/">IRE&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, members of Thunderdome&#8217;s data team headed to the Global Editors Network <a title="Editors' Lab" href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/editors-lab/nyt/" target="_blank">Editors&#8217; Lab</a> at the New York Times to wrestle with how to turn news storytelling into a game. <a title="Editors' Lab at the New York Times" href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/editors-lab-at-the-new-york-times/" target="_blank">The event</a> brought teams from <a title="Editors' Lab teams" href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/editors-lab-newsgaming-ideas/" target="_blank">10 of the country&#8217;s top news organizations</a> together to compete to build the best online news games over the course of a weekend.</p>
<p>Thunderdome data developer <a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" title="Vaughn Hagerty" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/vhagerty/">Vaughn Hagerty</a> described the genesis of <a title="The pitch for The Waffler" href="http://bit.ly/waffler-pitch">our game</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I came up with the basic idea for The Waffler while listening to Columbia Journalism School professor <a title="Susan McGregor" href="https://twitter.com/susanemcg" target="_blank">Susan McGregor</a> <a title="Susan McGregor's master class at #EditorsLab" href="http://bit.ly/ZGpymk" target="_blank">speak about game design</a> and the types of &#8220;play&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">agon (competition)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">alea (chance)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">mimicry (simulation)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">ilinx (vertigo)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I wondered how we might incorporate a number of those aspects into a game that could be (mostly) built during the two days of the competition. The team had already discussed how at least some of the other teams&#8217; entries were likely to be quiz-type apps. We also talked about apps that might highlight some of the shenanigans endemic in politics.</p>
<p>I thought, what about political flip-flopping, where a candidate changes his or her position on a major issue, usually to gain popularity and, of course, votes? Could we build a game to simulate that process?</p>
<p>Thus, <a title="The Waffler" href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/the-waffler/" target="_blank">The Waffler</a> was born.</p></blockquote>
<div style="width: 728px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/the-waffler/"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DFMEL.jpg" width="718" height="477" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Waffler, the game built by members of Project Thunderdome&#8217;s data team at the Editors&#8217;s Lab hack weekend.</p></div>
<blockquote><p>The Waffler was built with HTML, CSS, a few images and a little over 200 lines of JavaScript. I used jQuery for some parts, along with a JavaScript templating library called <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>. A few data structures in the JavaScript keep track of the player&#8217;s choices and help determine when he or she &#8220;waffles.&#8221; I added a timer to help add excitement to the game and to make it more realistic. After all, politicians really don&#8217;t have the option of saying something like &#8220;let me think about it&#8221; when asked about their stances on issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Vaughn worked on the game mechanics, graphics editor <a title="Nelson Hsu" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu/">Nelson Hsu</a> designed the presentation. Data editor <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/">Tom Meagher</a> selected the questions that are thrown at players, researched the real polling data and crafted the final presentation for the jury. The Waffler was deliberately built to be used in any kind of election, from presidential to city council. Its use of poll data and hot-button issues ensure it could have universal appeal.</p>
<p>At the end of the weekend, we were thrilled to learn that <a title="The Waffler" href="http://app.wizehive.com/voting/view/elny2013/14408/1236428/0" target="_blank">our entry</a> was chosen as the first runner-up by the judges.</p>
<p>The winning entry came from the Chicago Tribune&#8217;s <a title="Trib Apps" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">news apps team</a>, which designed a <a title="GEN Editors' Lab news game hackathon" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/gen-newsgaming-hackathon/" target="_blank">Game Center</a> to showcase a series of mini and micro games that could be integrated into any story. There were plenty of other great games that emerged. In a blog post, the team from ProPublica offered a fantastic, <a title="ProPublica nerd blog" href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/heartsaver-an-experiment-in-using-news-games-to-tell-a-story" target="_blank">in-depth look</a> at <a title="HeartSaver" href="http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/heartsaver" target="_blank">HeartSaver</a>, their health care game that will send your pulse racing.</p>
<p>Have you played the games from the <a title="Editors' Lab" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/gen-newsgaming-hackathon/" target="_blank">Editors&#8217; Lab hack event</a> at the Times? Which was your favorite?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Thunderdome data team explains what went into the playoff prediction interactive it produced in collaboration with the sports desk.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/01/interactive-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="interactive" /></p><p><em>Thunderdome Deputy Sports Editor <a title="Bobby Bonett" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/bbonett/">Bobby Bonett</a>, Data Developer <a title="Peggy Bustamante" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/pbustamante/">Peggy Bustamante</a> and Graphics Editor <a title="Nelson Hsu" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu/">Nelson Hsu</a> collaborated on our <a title="Predict the winner of the NFL playoffs" href="http://www.twincities.com/1000/ci_22346309/predict-nfl-playoffs?mobRedir=false">NFL playoffs interactive</a>, a project that tried to give readers a new way to explore the stats behind the post season.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Bobby Bonett explains the vision he brought to the data team:</strong><br />
The idea behind the playoff predictor was to create a data-driven interactive that let fans play with the stats to suggest which team could win each playoff match-up, based on historical performances in the playoffs. In order to appeal to fans beyond the statistically obsessed, we chose 10 standard statistics for the computations.These 10 stats for each NFL team that made the playoffs this year were then compared to the statistics of every playoff team since 1971. (We gathered these statistics from <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/">pro-football-reference.com</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305" alt="interactive" src="/content/uploads/2013/01/interactive.png" width="530" height="397" /></p>
<p>As teams were defeated each week, the app updated to whittle down to the final matchups and, ultimately, the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The 2013 data was compared to the historical data in two different ways. For pass offense, pass defense, rush offense, rush defense, points for and points against, team statistics were compared to the league average and converted to a percentage. For example, if a team passed for 4,000 yards and the league average was 5,000 yards, that team would have a value of 80 percent. This normalized the data to account for changes in football over the years, specifically the shift from rush-heavy offenses of the past to today’s pass-heavy offenses.</p>
<p>Then, the 2013 teams were matched up in each category to similar playoff teams since 1971. “Similar” was defined as within 4 percent in a certain category for the divisional round, and within 8 percent in the championship round. For outliers, the ranges were expanded to ensure there was a significant sample size. We then looked at the record of those similar teams, and assigned a percentage chance that the 2013 team would win based on historical results. For example, if nine of the 20 similar teams in “pass offense” won their playoff games, the 2013 team would have a 45 percent chance of winning based strictly on their pass offense.</p>
<p>For turnover margin, record, seed and home/away values, teams were matched up with other teams that had the same values. The data was again normalized for turnover margin and record to account for seasons that didn’t have a 16-game schedule. A percentage chance of winning was then assigned to each team in these values the same way.</p>
<p>Using this data, we devised a formula that would produce a percentage chance of each team winning each match-up based on user-selected and user-ranked statistics. For instance, a user could select pass offense, rush offense and points in a particular order, and the formula would weigh the three statistics accordingly for each team, computing a percentage chance of each team winning the game.</p>
<p><strong>With that framework in mind, Peggy Bustamante describes the app’s development:</strong><br />
Bobby, Nelson and I hashed out the project, discussing not only layout but also what we wanted the functionality to be, and so we mocked up a look for the project on the dry erase wall at Thunderdome.</p>
<p><b id="internal-source-marker_0.5500299513805658"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0JRzfGIw79m8kulGIcicOntsanSEpBb4jxFMi48_7CusRxl21NrV7l2o8OUWfjNtAyYZfIS7hRilmQiPVP9DvnD1SnCaD1S6JgOM5pHR9TgofbXAYXU8" width="615px;" height="328px;" /></b></p>
<p>While Nelson constructed the HTML and CSS, Bobby and I figured out the formula to predict the percentage chance of each team winning its match-up. It needed to allow users to select the statistics they wanted to consider and how heavily those statistics would be weighted, using a sortable stack on the left. (Nelson used <a title="jQuery UI sortable action" href="http://jqueryui.com/sortable/" target="_blank">JQuery UI sortable</a> action to create that functionality.)</p>
<p>Nelson left the HTML team data blank so the slots could be dynamically populated from a Google spreadsheet, and updated easily each week by the sports desk without reworking the base code each time. This will also allow for re-use for other competitions, like the MLB playoffs.</p>
<p>We used two Google spreadsheets: one for the front end to populate the team stats and one for the back end to house the data that would be used to calculate the win-percentage prediction.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>For the front end, I first imported the data from the Google Speadsheet in JSON format and then re-loaded the data into a JSON object with keys of my own choosing. Having that control over key names became vital for the back-end portion. I then created loops to dynamically update the text in the HTML:</p>
<pre>for (var i=0; i&lt;matchupsLen; i++) {
    $("#mod" + i + " p.expertText").html(allData[i * 2][0].expert);
    $("#mod" + i + " .datetime").html(allData[i * 2][0].date + " &lt;br /&gt;" + allData[i * 2][0].time);
    $("#mod" + i + " .line").html("&lt;span class='sideHeader'&gt;Line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;" + allData[i * 2][0].line);
    …
    …
}</pre>
<p dir="ltr">The code for the back end data calculations was a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>We needed a formula that would allow users to filter and weight the statistics by the categories they choose.</p>
<p>This is the final formula that Bobby created:</p>
<pre>(a)[b-(10-c)]+(a1)[b1-(10-c)]… / [b-(10-c)]+[b1-(10-c)]…</pre>
<p>a = stat (displayed in a percentage chance of winning, ie. Team X has a 40% chance of winning based on pass-offense)<br />
b = weight (the weight of the chosen statistics from the left rail; ie one stat chosen is worth 10, two stats are 10, 9, three stats are 10, 9, 8, etc.)<br />
c = number of teams ranked</p>
<p>The rationale for the (10-c) portion of the formula was to properly calculate the weighting of each statistic. For example, if three items were chosen, we wanted them to be weighted 3a, 2b and 1c, not 10a, 9b and 8c.</p>
<p>The result of the formula would be a percentage chance of each team winning each match-up. However, this data would be calculated for each team independent of its opponent in its match-up. So the final step was to relate the two opponents’ percentage chances of winning out of 100 percent.</p>
<p>The formula for that:</p>
<pre>x/(x+y)  =   z/100</pre>
<p>x = Team 1’s independent chance of winning<br />
y = Team 2’s independent chance of winning<br />
z = Team 1’s chance of winning compared to Team 2’s chance of winning, as a percentage</p>
<p>For the back-end, we agreed that the win probabilities would be calculated any time the user changes the order of the statistics, or checks or unchecks a statistic. A listener is set to capture those changes and set off the calculation process, which has two steps.</p>
<p>When a change occurs, the doneSort() function is triggered:</p>
<pre>function doneSort() {

    var sortedIDs = [];

    $("#sortableStats input:checked").each(function(i) {
         sortedIDs[i] = $(this).attr('id');
    });
    calculateWin(sortedIDs);
<b><b>}</b></b></pre>
<p>This captures the ids of all the items that are selected, in order, and drops them into an array. That array is then passed to the calculateWin() function, which steps through Bobby’s formula for each team matchup.</p>
<p>calculateWin() first checks if the array is empty (no stat items checked) and zeroes out the percentages if that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p>As with the front-end, I loaded the data needed to make the calculations from a Google spreadsheet and then put the data into a JSON object. For the back-end data, it was necessary to match the keys to the #ids in the sortable items on the left, so that I could match them after doneSort() captured all the ids:</p>
<p>HTML:</p>
<pre>&lt;div&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" id="<span style="color: #ff0000">a0</span>" onchange="cbChanged(this, 0);"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pass Offense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>JSON:</p>
<pre>for (var i=0; i&lt;dataLen; i++) {
    var counter = gsData.feed.entry[i].gsx$id.$t;

<span style="color: #0000ff">    calcData</span>[counter] = [ {
        myid: gsData.feed.entry[i].gsx$id.$t,
        matchup: gsData.feed.entry[i].gsx$matchup.$t,
        team: gsData.feed.entry[i].gsx$team.$t,
        <span style="color: #ff0000">a0:</span> gsData.feed.entry[i].gsx$passo.$t,
        a1: gsData.feed.entry[i].gsx$passd.$t,
        a2: gsData.feed.entry[i].gsx$rusho.$t, 
        …
        …
    }];     
}</pre>
<p>The actual calculation is fairly straightforward, reconstructing the formula using variables and arrays.</p>
<p>Once the selected items are captured, the array took the selected values from the Google Spreadsheet JSON data (<span style="color: #0000ff">calcData</span>), multiplied them by the weight [in this case 5 for the a9 stat, 4 for a7 stat, 3 for a8 stat, etc.], and then added them to the variable summing all the totals.</p>
<pre>for (var j=0; j&lt;statIDsLen; j++) {
    statsTeam1 += parseInt(eval("calcData[k][0]." + statIDs[j])) * weight;
    statsTeam2 += parseInt(eval("calcData[k+1][0]." + statIDs[j])) * weight;
    statsDivisor += weight;
    weight--;
}</pre>
<p>I also totaled just the weights (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) into the variable “statsDivisor” to get the percentage for each team.</p>
<pre>temp1perc = statsTeam1 / statsDivisor;
temp2perc = statsTeam2 / statsDivisor;</pre>
<p>Then to get the final percentages for the teams to add up to 100:</p>
<pre>team1winperc = Math.round((100 * temp1perc) / (temp1perc + temp2perc));
team2winperc = Math.round((100 * temp2perc) / (temp1perc + temp2perc));</pre>
<p>And the final step was to drop the percentages into the HTML elements:</p>
<pre>$("#mod" + i + " .team1 .numBox").text(team1winperc + "%")
$("#mod" + i + " .team2 .numBox").text(team2winperc + "%")</pre>
<p>As a result, each time a user made any action on the left, the interactive updated each team’s chances of winning.</p>
<p>And, in several cases, we heard that this encouraged users to play with the statistics until their favorite team was favored to win their match-up.</p>

<p>Not long after that, our fledgling data team started to discuss how we wanted to think about Thunderdome&#8217;s mission. Inspired by the <a title="Agile Manifesto" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">agile manifesto</a> and the <a title="Show your work" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/09/02/show-your-work/" target="_blank">ethos of other news and data developers</a> around the country, we crafted our own humble manifesto. We&#8217;ve posted the text as a repository on <a title="DFM Data Manifesto" href="https://github.com/DFMdata/Manifesto">our Github account</a>, where we will share any coding projects that we release to the open source community. In the meantime, our manifesto, declaring our values, speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The DFM Data Team Manifesto</h2>
<p>As journalists and developers, we believe strong data reporting leads to engaging news applications and empowers our local newsrooms to produce coverage that users want and need.</p>
<p>This belief informs the things we value:</p>
<ul>
<li>deep, contextual analysis and presentation of data.</li>
<li><a title="Profiles of the victims of the Sandy Hook shootings" href="http://nhregister.com/articles/2012/12/18/news/doc50cce7f2df5fa708346092.txt" target="_blank">applications with broad regional or national appeal.</a></li>
<li>reusable tools and frameworks.</li>
<li>providing our users the best experience and interaction possible.</li>
<li>working in close cooperation with journalists around the company and within Thunderdome and training them to bring data analysis techniques into their own daily reporting.</li>
<li>openness and transparency, in the subjects we cover and in our reporting and development. To this end, we document our processes, <a title="How we did it: Our Connecticut Superintendents database and map" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/01/11/it-connecticut-superintendents-salary-map-database/" target="_blank">show the work behind our work </a>publicly and share our data and tools with the open source, reader and journalism communities whenever we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a rapidly changing industry, our mission may evolve over time, but our core values will remain at the heart of our work.</p></blockquote>

<h3>From Viktoria:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Originally, the project started out small &#8211; I was just gathering some of the local contracts, because we had several new superintendents. Then the idea grew into &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we do the entire state?&#8221; As my editor said, &#8220;Connecticut is a pretty small state, so you can actually do that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">More than half of the districts responded to our Freedom of Information requests quickly. Only two school districts made us pick up the contracts in person and charged us for it, <a href="http://www.middletownpress.com/articles/2012/11/10/news/doc509de85319a81638476929.txt" target="_blank">which we noted in a story</a> we did about all the responses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">I started a Google spreadsheet to keep track of the basic info we were looking for &#8211; salary for current year, next year, third year, vacation time, mileage, other benefits, etc. A big struggle was making sure all the numbers collected actually added up, because some of the contracts only reported salary (including tax-sheltered annuity), while others split this into several sections of a contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">These two passages excerpted from the contracts we examined are representative of why parsing them was, at times, a confusing process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;The Board shall contribute Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) to the Superintendent’s base annual salary; from which total base salary the Superintendent shall pay, through a reduction in his base salary (elective deferral) the amount of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00), to an annuity designated by the Superintendent.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>&#8220;The superintendent&#8217;s salary consists of a) base component of $162,000, b) an additional amount of 4% of base salary, c) An additional sum which is equal to 7.25% of the total of the amount specified in sections (a) and (b) above.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Once the spreadsheet was almost complete, I teamed up with the <a title="DFM Data team" href="http://twitter.com/dfmdata" target="_blank">Thunderdome data crew</a>, who said they could build off the spreadsheet I had already done and make it look really cool. We just needed to clean up some numbers&#8230; One thing I learned is that you cannot have numbers and letters in the same field (I had made notes next to salaries, or put a range for some, or put vacation days carried over in addition to other vacation time, and mixed annual mileage stipends with just &#8220;IRS rate&#8221; which did not fly for the searchable database and all had to be adjusted).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Because I had randomly decided to include the school district size from the beginning of my project (thank God!), I could later compare the superintendents by district size. I was also able to add a column for cost per student, where I let the spreadsheet divide the superintendent&#8217;s salary by the number of students in the district.</p>
<h3>From Peggy:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">After Viktoria and I discussed the data she had gathered and what she envisioned for presenting it, we settled on a searchable/sortable table with a linked map that would use graded colors to show salary ranges around the state.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">To create the map, I needed to get the boundary/shapefiles for the Connecticut school districts prepped and ready to merge with the spreadsheet of data. I downloaded the shapefiles from <a title="Census TIGER line shape files" href="http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html" target="_blank">the Census Bureau website</a> and converted them to KML using <a href="http://www.shpescape.com/">Shape to Fusion</a>. I then merged Viktoria&#8217;s spreadsheet with the table of KML files using <a title="Google Fusion Tables" href="http://tables.googlelabs.com/" target="_blank">Fusion Tables</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The initial pass resulted in an incomplete map, full of holes where districts presumably should be. There were three folders in the Census zip file I downloaded and I had assumed the “unified school districts” shapefiles meant all of the school districts. Never assume. I had to send all three (elementary, secondary and unified districts) through shpescape.com, combine them all into one file, and then delete some overlapping districts. Other bug-inducing factors were variations in district naming between the Census files and Viktoria’s file, such as “Regional district 06” in one was “Region 6” in another. Another glitch in building a complete map was that one district had multiple polygons, which did not import smoothly and had to be mucked with to add it to a row in the Fusion Table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">After all these mapping bugs were addressed, we debated whether there wasn’t one more little district <a title="&quot;The Southwick Jog&quot;" href="http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm" target="_blank">missing at the top of Connecticut</a>. We turned to Google Maps to discover that no district was missing, it was just Massachusetts jutting into Connecticut in an odd little keyhole formation along Connecticut’s northern border. Who knew?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Once the mapping issues were resolved, we pulled the data into a table/map framework that Vaughn Hagerty had built for a previous project. Some of the data was not showing up properly because there were irregularities in the data types, some text in cells that were designated for numbers (e.g. salaries). The solution was for Viktoria to remove the text from the cells and incorporate comments into the introduction and footnotes.</p>
<h3>From Vaughn:<em> </em></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The map and table, along with its functionality, reflect a key goal for the data team: creating reusable code that’s (relatively) easy to implement. This app uses a JavaScript library that I&#8217;ve been developing to simplify the process of displaying data on a map, in a table and, soon, in graphs and charts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The code is definitely still in development, as we hone it and add features and, eventually, include a configuration wizard. Although we&#8217;re not really ready to release the code, which is still a bit rough, I can talk a bit about what it does. It depends on open-source libraries such as <a title="Backbone.js" href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">backbone.js</a>, <a title="Underscore.js" href="http://underscorejs.org" target="_blank">underscore.js</a>, <a title="Handlebars.js" href="http://handlebarsjs.com" target="_blank">handlebars.js</a>, <a title="jQuery" href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, the <a title="Google Chart Tools API" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/" target="_blank">Google Chart Tools API</a> (for tables and graphs) and either <a title="Google Maps" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> or the <a title="Leaflet" href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> OpenStreetMap API. We hope to add <a title="D3.js" href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> support for more sophisticated graphs and already have cribbed some functions from that great library to handle comma-separated (CSV) values.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Here’s how it works in a nutshell. There are two pieces that need to be provided to thunderdome.js:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Data. So far, we’ve used <a title="Who we serve map" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-serve/" target="_blank">comma-separated data</a>, straight JSON or, in the case of this salary project, a feed from Google Fusion Table as initial data sources. More are planned soon. Ultimately, that data is reformatted and fed to backbone.js, which allows us to do things such as provide default values. (Note to the geeks out there: We’re just barely scratching the surface in terms of backbone integration.) Essentially, this data is a key-value store, similar to a database table or an Excel spreadsheet, which allows us to reference specific pieces, just like in a database.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Configuration. Want a map? Tell thunderdome.js what kind (Google or OpenStreetMap), what styling you want, whether you want to display pins or polygon shapes on the map, how you want to differentiate among pin or polygon colors, what fields you want in a window that pops up when users click on a pin or polygon … and some other stuff, including formatting certain fields correctly as numbers (with commas) or currency and legends on the map. Want a table? Specify the fields you want to show, whether you want to search on a field or filter by one, whether you want a map popup to fire when a user clicks on a certain record, how many records you want to show on each page … and some more stuff, including the number formatting mentioned above.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Finally, you need some simple HTML and CSS to hold and style the pieces on a web page and to specify how you want certain visual elements such as your map popups or legends to look.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Note that almost all of these items are a la carte: You can just display a map or a just a table and you can pick and choose which features you want.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The tie between the table record and the map is actually fairly simple. As markers are placed on a map, we also store them (in a JavaScript array) based on a value in the data. That way we can reference them later. Currently, that value also has to be displayed in the table, though we hope to alter the script to make it more flexible. Those markers are essentially the same ones displayed on the map, which means we can do things such as emulating a user’s click, which opens that marker’s popup. When a user clicks on that record in the table, thunderdome.js retrieves the unique value displayed in the table, finds that marker we stored and tells it, “Hey, guess what? You got clicked! Open that popup already!”</p>

<p>Now that our data team here is at full strength, we thought this would be a good time to introduce ourselves, beyond the 140 characters we&#8217;re allowed on our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dfmdata">Twitter feed</a>. Once you&#8217;re acquainted with us, if you&#8217;d like to learn more about data journalism, you should submit a request to join our <a title="DFM data Google Group" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&amp;fromgroups#!forum/digitalfirstdata">email discussion list</a>, where we share ideas, tutorials and resources with our DFM colleagues across the country.</p>
<h2>Peggy Bustamante</h2>
<p>A longtime print journalist, Peggy stumbled into web development while building multimedia projects in the mid-90s.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Peggy Bustamante" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/pbustamante_avatar.jpeg" width="216" height="216" />Joining us from Newsday in Long Island, Peggy is obsessed with investigating new forms of storytelling through code. Her projects range from simpler forms of data presentation such as <a href="http://longisland.newsday.com/templates/simpleDB/?pid=484">tables and maps</a> to data-driven interactives (<a href="http://longisland.newsday.com/sports/baseball/freeagents/">Major League Baseball free agency</a>, <a href="http://longisland.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-poll/">Oscars polls</a>, <a href="http://longisland.newsday.com/sports/hockey/islanders/john-tavares/">sports report cards</a>) to experimental forms of multimedia/video presentations (a <a href="http://sports.newsday.com/boxing/a-fighting-chance/">12-part series about fighters</a> at a <a href="http://sports.newsday.com/boxing/a-fighting-chance/?video=the-gym">Long Island boxing gym</a>).</p>
<p>A firm believer that the best work comes from collaboration, she welcomes the opportunity to hash over ideas for cool projects, and she&#8217;s eager to spread her addiction to coding, teaching web development to anyone willing to learn.</p>
<p>Born on a small volcanic island off the coast of Alaska, Peggy has peripatetically lived all over the world. Consequently, she has an inordinate fascination with migration and will be following closely the <a href="http://www.outofedenwalk.com/">Out of Eden walk project</a>, while making plans to do the same someday. Peggy has a daughter, Alejandra, whom she dragged in and out of various newsrooms over the years, yet failed to lure into the news biz. Alejandra is now a fashion designer in Los Angeles.</p>
<h2>Nelson Hsu</h2>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Nelson Hsu" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/nhsu_avatar.jpeg" width="244" height="244" /></p>
<p>Nelson is the designer/front-end developer on the team and also serves as the graphics editor for Thunderdome. He&#8217;s had prior stops at the Washington Post and at NPR where he held similar roles.</p>
<p>Nelson&#8217;s projects range from <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2011/10/toxic-air/#4.00/39.00/-84.00" target="_blank">news apps</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/07/25/156991065/track-the-spread-of-aids-across-the-globe" target="_blank">simple interactives</a>, and <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/07/21/138560459/sizing-up-space-a-visual-history" target="_blank">static graphics</a> to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/12/27/144322307/pop-up-politics-gop-stump-speeches-with-a-twist" target="_blank">multimedia presentations</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever gets the story or information across the best way, that&#8217;s what I like to work on,&#8221; Nelson says.</p>
<h2>Vaughn Hagerty</h2>
<p>Vaughn Hagerty has more than 20 years of experience as a journalist and more than 15 as a web developer. He has won numerous awards for his online work, including a 2009 Knight-Batten Award for Innovation in Journalism for <a title="MyReporter.com" href="http://www.myreporter.com" target="_blank">MyReporter.com</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Vaughn Hagerty" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/vhagerty_avatar-300x300.jpeg" width="243" height="243" />Vaughn began writing code in the mid-1990s, when he was metro editor at the Corpus Christi, Texas, Caller-Times. It started with a single-sentence email from the paper’s executive editor: “What’s the delay in getting us on the Internet?” A few months of mad code dash later, the first edition of Caller.com was born.</p>
<p>He’s handy with programming languages such as PHP, Perl and JavaScript and with setting up and managing database-driven applications using <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/what-is-mysql.html">MySQL (which he pronounces &#8220;My Ess Cue Ell&#8221;).</a> Then again, he also calls those old image files <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format#Pronunciation">&#8220;jifs&#8221;</a>. Go figure.</p>
<p>Before joining Digital First Media in October 2012, Vaughn was a web development manager for the New York Times Regional Media Group, based at the StarNews in Wilmington, N.C, where he still lives and works.</p>
<h2>Tom Meagher</h2>
<p>Tom Meagher built his first rudimentary website in 1994 and has been infatuated with the possibilities of the World Wide Web ever since.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Tom Meagher" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Tom-Meagher_avatar.jpeg" width="253" height="255" /></p>
<div>
<p>Tom has spent much of his career working for local newspapers in New Jersey. As a municipal reporter covering Paterson, New Jersey, Tom built databases to track local campaign finance abuses, profiteering from municipal tax liens and the warehousing of the needy in substandard housing. In the process, he learned to specialize in computer-assisted reporting. He eventually wound up at the Star-Ledger, New Jersey&#8217;s largest newspaper, where he led a team charged with mining databases for enterprise stories.</p>
<p>He joined Thunderdome in August of 2012 and is thrilled to be able to combine his long love affair with the web and his affinity for strong data reporting. Tom is a big proponent of <a title="Try Git." href="http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1">version control</a> and <a title="DFM Data Team on Github" href="https://github.com/dfmdata">Github</a>, and he is an advanced beginner in the Python programming language. In his free time, he helps to organize <a title="Hack Jersey" href="http://www.hackjersey.com/" target="_blank">Hack Jersey</a>, an open public data hackathon intended to bring developers and journalists together to learn from each other. He&#8217;s always happy to discuss cheeseburgers, soccer and beer.</p>
