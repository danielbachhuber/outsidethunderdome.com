<p>Ever since we saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8v_2L9v1U">the first trailer trickle out earlier this year</a>, we knew &#8220;Man Of Steel&#8221; was poised to become one of the summer&#8217;s biggest blockbusters. Our various DFM film critics from around the country confirmed this notion during our <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_23088030/summer-movie-previews-live-chat-esteemed-film-critics">Summer Movie Preview chat</a> last month so we got to work on brainstorming engaging ways to approach the film&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>Given that Superman has existed for multiple decades across multiple platforms (film, TV, comic books, cartoons), we knew we wanted to highlight the history and evolution of the character, rather than focus exclusively on the new film. We settled on the idea of a composite illustration. Specifically: a face.</p>
<p>Features producer Angi Carter began compiling key data points: name of production, format, lead actor, release date and skeletal summary. Then, I narrowed down this long list to seven key actors, fleshed out the summaries, and worked with Katie Wood from PhotoDome to find photos of the various leading men (both in and out of the Superman costume).</p>
<p>Graphics editor Nelson Hsu explains how he put all of the above pieces together to make the final product:</p>
<blockquote><p>The key to pulling this off was finding the right photos. You can make the argument finding the photos was actually harder than the design and development. Originally, we wanted to get all the actors in the same iconic Superman pose (fists resting on the hips, elbows out), but that proved to be really really hard. So we decided to go with the actors faces, which was still hard to find the right photos for some of the earlier actors. Ideally, we wouldn’t have those black bars, but the lack of usable photos for Kirk Alyn forced us to go that route.</p>
<p>While the photos were being researched and collected, I started prototyping the interaction. I usually start by sketching it out, but I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do so I skipped that and went straight into coding it. Pretty simple concept: click on a slice, reveal the full photo and show some information. Besides jQuery, no other plugins or other libraries were used. All the HTML, CSS and JavaScript was written from scratch. Without getting into the weeds of the code, here’s how I approached it:</p>
<p>1. Create a div for each actor and load their full image in as the background of that div.</p>
<p>2. Resize each div, position it and reposition the backgrounds so you get the full face composite.</p>
<p>3. Using jQuery, animate the div width, position and background get animated from their current positions back to 0, giving you the curtain effect.</p>
<p>4. When a user closes the full image, it just animates back to the original positions.</p>
<p>5. Each of the text details are just divs that are hidden and revealed when their corresponding slice is clicked.</p>
<p>Right now, everything is basically hard-coded, but I plan on making this something more templa-tized and powered off a Google Doc or json so look for it on <a href="https://github.com/DFMdata">GitHub</a> in the near future. If you are looking for the code, just view the source.</p></blockquote>

It was a quirky show about a quirky paper company, and we knew that we wanted to celebrate the final episode in an appropriately quirky manner.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re Digital First, yes, but creating a project related to paper seemed to make the most sense. Fans of the show will remember the infamous bobble head doll that sat atop character Dwight Schrute&#8217;s desk for multiple seasons. What if we offered readers something that they could build and place on their own desks after the show ended?</p>
<p>The Denver Post saw great success with its <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/tag/desktop-tim-tebow/">Desktop Tim Tebow</a> paper figures project (and later, Desktop Peyton Manning). Why not translate this idea to key characters on &#8220;The Office&#8221;? DFM technology producer Davis Shaver alerted me to <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/artist/2012/08/27/creating-25-unique-paper-figures-that-represent-yaiaa-high-school-football-teams-was-a-fun-time/">a similar paper figures project that the York Daily Record created</a>, so I emailed their design team to see if they wanted to get on board with this project.</p>
<p>Not only did they agree to contribute, but they knocked it out of the park. The killer design team of Samantha Dellinger and Brad Jennings turned around sharp, fast, entertaining work in a matter of days. Nothing was missing. Detailed instructions? Check. Printable PDFs? Check. Dwight&#8217;s stapler in jello? Check. Stanley&#8217;s crossword puzzle? Check. Michael&#8217;s &#8220;World&#8217;s Best Boss&#8221; mug? You bet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56293054-223/quot-build-company-favorite.html.csp">Revisit the project in full here</a>, and <a href="http://www.tout.com/u/diane5hoffman">watch a few Touts</a> that staffers from the Pottstown Mercury put together using the finished product below:</p>

Hendrickson is now Entertainment Channel Manger for Thunderdome and Petty is Social Media Editor at the Post (and Central Region Engagement Editor for DFM)." /></p><p>I left The Denver Post newsroom a little after 6 p.m. on Halloween night. It would be my last time walking out onto Broadway and Colfax, arguably the nexus of the city of Denver, and in many ways, Colorado as a whole.</p>
<p>I had been there two years and two months, plus 10 weeks in 2009 as an intern. It was my first job out of college, and my first paid internship a year before that.  It was the first publication I wrote for that needed no modifiers in conversation. <em>&#8220;You know, that thick weekly in that yellow box&#8230; that music magazine that used to be monthly&#8230; that blog from that site. No, not that site.&#8221;</em> It was the first place that made me feel like a real, working, no-concept-of-a-time-card journalist.</p>
<p>For Colorado residents, and much of the west, The Denver Post is a major part of their day. It&#8217;s there on the living room floor. It&#8217;s a companion during lunch. It&#8217;s a tab next to Gmail and Facebook and Twitter during the work day. Even through countless rounds of buyouts, layoffs, shrinking print sections and disappearing columnists, it&#8217;s still very much part of the regional conversation.</p>
<p>That pageview-guzzling, Pulitzer-winning, 120-year-old publication has a sure footing at or near the top of the Digital First Media family of more than 800 print and online products. And when Post editor Greg Moore first explained DFM&#8217;s forthcoming Project Thunderdome to staffers about one year ago, there was uniform skepticism. Distrust. Stiff-arms. It was a new idea in a business built on legacy, tradition and precedent.</p>
<p>It was weird.</p>
<p>Having worked in a mostly digital capacity at the Post, I knew I wanted to be a part of Thunderdome. Though, that&#8217;s not to say I was without hesitations about what the job would actually entail.</p>
<p>Upon my arrival in Manhattan some 24 hours after I left the newsroom in Denver on that last day, some 36 hours after Hurricane Sandy had punched much of NYC in its collective face (including the DFM headquarters in the Financial District), the uncertainty was still there.</p>
<p>But from those first few days, everything seemed to click. The Thunderdome staffers are sharp, quick-witted, digitally savvy and extremely ambitious. They love print journalism, but won&#8217;t hesitate to share a meme or a YouTube clip around the office. They are tapped in to the competitive landscape and really, truly, want this project to succeed.</p>
<p>And more than anything, perhaps, they value DFM newsrooms both big and small. The journalists here came from different backgrounds, from different parts of the country, from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Associated Press and from papers you probably haven&#8217;t heard of &#8212; and they know everything in between matters. I&#8217;m happy to be here.</p>
