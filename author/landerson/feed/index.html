				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/180407759-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="(Photo by ThinkStock)" /></p><p>Before I went to the annual <a title="DFM at #NICAR14" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/live/dfm-nicar14/">NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting)</a> conference, I often thought of data as numbers gathered and distributed by officials or academics — like annual crime statistics or Census databases. If no such data existed, then I thought journalists were out of luck.</p>
<p>But NICAR taught me that data can be so much more than official statistics.</p>
<p>So here’s how to channel your inner Nellie Bly and DIY (Do It Yourself) data.</p>
<p><b>Look at the notes in your notebook. </b>That’s data. When we take notes on something, say, a privately funded educational program, we record the 5 W’s. That’s data.</p>
<p>For inspiration, check out: <a href="http://homicidewatch.org/" target="_blank">Homicide Watch D.C.</a> This site gathers data from police reports, court documents and court hearings to examine every homicide in Washington, D.C. The thorough reporting allows the creators, Laura and Chris Amico, to analyze trends by race, location and more.</p>
<p><b>Documents are full of data</b>, we just don’t see it as such. When going through piles and piles of documents, record what you find in a database and turn it into data you can analyze.</p>
<p>Check out USA Today’s <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/mass-killings/index.html" target="_blank">“Behind the Bloodshed”</a> on mass killings in the United States. The FBI records murders in which four or more people died, but USA Today found dozens of such killings (the tan circles on the chart) of which the FBI had no record. The team turned to news reports, set Google Alerts and pored over thousands of police reports from killings across the country to find a truer picture of mass killings in the U.S.</p>
<p><b>And then there’s the Internet.</b> If you can’t find data on your subject, turn to Internet chat sites, social media and more. Turn your findings into data.</p>
<p>Check out Reuters’ <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1" target="_blank">“The Child Exchange.”</a> A Reuter’s reporter was researching adoptions online and came across a Yahoo group in which parents sought new homes for children they adopted from abroad and other people were looking for such kids to bring home. The practice is entirely unregulated, so a parent can sign away a child to a stranger and that’s that. Reporter Meghan Twohey took screenshots of every post about a child and recorded all data to track their ages, genders, whether they had behavioral problems and more.</p>
<p><b>Don’t forget science.</b> <b> </b>Curious about the water quality in your town? Take your own samples and send them into a lab. If you don’t trust the official report or no one is keeping track of an issue, use science to keep track of it yourself.</p>
<h1>So how do you do a DIY data project?</h1>
<p><b>1. Plan. Plan. Plan. </b>What do you want to know? What questions will you ask the data and people? Determine your methodology.</p>
<p><b>2. Dive in. </b>You have to start sometime.</p>
<p><b>3. Keep it manageable and quantifiable. </b>You can’t look at everything.</p>
<p><b>4. Bounce ideas off a partner or editor.</b></p>
<p><b>5. Don’t recreate the wheel. </b>Verify results and findings with academics and experts.</p>
<p><strong>6. Talk to people.</strong> Data can only go so far. It&#8217;s the people that make a story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/ire_twitter-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="ire_twitter" /></p><p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This guest post was authored by <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/l_m_anderson" target="_blank">Lindsey Anderson</a></strong> (@L_M_Anderson), a Digital First Media reporter for the Las Cruces Sun. On Jan. 14 and 15, Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors (IRE) provided our DFM colleagues in New Mexico with their intensive TNT program (<a href="http://www.ire.org/events-and-training/tnt/" target="_blank">Total Newsroom Training</a>). In the spirit of sharing, Lindsey has written up five key takeaways from the program. Anderson will attend #NICAR14 as part of our <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/12/20/nicar14-digital-represents-winners-are/" target="_blank">DFM Represents program</a> later this winter. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MeganLuther" target="_blank">Megan Luther</a> with <a href="http://www.ire.org/" target="_blank">Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors</a> stopped by the <a href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/" target="_blank">Las Cruces Sun-News</a> newsroom this week to train us — and some of our colleagues from the <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com" target="_blank">El Paso Times</a>, the <a href="www.alamogordonews.com" target="_blank">Alamogordo Daily News</a>, the <a href="www.daily-times.com" target="_blank">Farmington Daily Times</a>, and the <a href="www.currentargus.com" target="_blank">Carlsbad Current-Argus</a> — on how to foster a watchdog culture in our newsroom.</p>
<p>Here are some key things I learned and am already putting into practice:</p>
<p><strong>1. Start small.</strong> A watchdog culture doesn&#8217;t mean every story is a 4,000-word investigation. It can be as simple as not taking statements and reports at face value. Ask &#8220;Where did you get that statistic?&#8221; &#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; &#8220;What caused that?&#8221; A <em>basic</em> story reports that officials say teen pregnancy rates are dropping. A <em>good</em> story perceives a pattern. A <em>great</em> story explains why that pattern is occurring.</p>
<p><strong>2. Megan&#8217;s litmus test for whether something is worth an investigation: Does it affect everyday people?</strong> Does it plow new ground? Are there victims? Does it offer room for reform? As Megan said, you can&#8217;t fix stupid; if the solution to a problem is for people to stop being stupid, it&#8217;s probably not worth your time to investigate it.</p>
<p><strong>3. Background, background, background</strong>: Newsrooms should require background checks of individuals who are subjects of profiles and features. Background new hires, even in sports. Request job candidates&#8217; resumes or find them on LinkedIn. Background a new business that&#8217;s coming to town and its top executives. You don&#8217;t want to be the news organization who extols the benefits of a company moving into your town only to find they have 50 OSHA violations. Even if you&#8217;re writing about unemployment benefits from someone&#8217;s point of view, background them. Check civil and criminal filings, sex offender registries, OSHA, the federal government contract blacklist. Bookmark these links:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sex offender registry</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.nsopw.gov/en-US" target="_blank">http://www.nsopw.gov/en-US</a></li>
<li><em><strong>Federal inmate locator</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.bop.gov/Locate/" target="_blank">http://www.bop.gov/Locate/</a> (Google state inmate search to find individual state locators)</li>

<li><em><strong>Hospital inspections</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.hospitalinspections.org/" target="_blank">http://www.hospitalinspections.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Keep a data arsenal.</strong> Key to include calls for service logs from law enforcement, city and county claims, births, marriages, deaths, accident reports and data, budgets and payrolls. These datasheets will come in handy when working on a story — and they&#8217;ll lend themselves to a vast number of stories.</p>
<p><strong>5. Before you request public records, do your research</strong>. Know the forms, processes, program names, formats and more that are filled out before requesting data. Check federal agencies&#8217; FOIA logs to see what others have requested. Look for data manuals and presentations describing what data an organization must keep and for how long.</p>
