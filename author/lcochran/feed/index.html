The Thunderdome-produced health channel has launched on Digital First Media websites.</p>
<p>This is the first of our national Thunderdome content channels to go live across the company&#8217;s 75 daily newspaper websites and it gives readers the tools they need to make smarter decisions during substantial life, and health, changes.</p>
<p>You can find &#8216;Health&#8217; under the Lifestyles dropdown in the top navigation of most Digital First Media websites. Or simply replace &#8216;newspaper&#8217; with your local DFM site name in this URL: <strong>http://dfm.<em>newspaper</em>.com/health</strong> (Example: <a href="http://dfm.reformer.com/health" target="_blank">http://dfm.reformer.com/health</a> or <a href="http://dfm.santacruzsentinel.com/health">http://dfm.santacruzsentinel.com/health</a>).</p>
<h2><strong>What to expect from our health channel</strong></h2>
<p>Our content strategy for health has some crossover into a few non-traditional aspects of health, including parenting, safety and financial health. You can expect to see less about early drug trials and pharma news, far-off scientific advances, and more about actionable, news you can use-type content with a focus on navigating important life decisions.</p>
<p>The channel will feature daily content from the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-serve/" target="_blank">Digital First Media network of newsrooms</a>, as well as articles from content partners such as <a href="http://dfm.santacruzsentinel.com/article/how-to-make-realistic-new-years-resolutions/67510581203fc9657dea94c49dddadb4" target="_blank">US News</a>, <a href="http://dfm.santacruzsentinel.com/article/dario-is-a-connected-gadget-for-managing-diabetes/7059efd3a79df42c9e885a438568dca2" target="_blank">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/" target="_blank">Slate</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://dfm.santacruzsentinel.com/article/the-97-best-hospitals-for-hip-and-knee-replacements-according-to-medicare/c19080948dd7034eb2e44eabbe02f72e" target="_blank">Kaiser Health News</a> and <a href="http://dfm.santacruzsentinel.com/article/5-steps-to-financial-health-for-women/76a733c3a6ed95a405ea0bed44ace129" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>.</p>

During the second week of November the entire staff gathered for the first time since inception.</p>
<p>The features team is spread across the United States so it was especially great to officially meet, form ideas and really understand how we can work as a team to empower local newsrooms. We learned a lot about each other and Thunderdome. We wanted to share a couple of the factoids we personally found to be most surprising.</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/jhendrickson/"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-452 alignright" title="John-Hendrickson_avatar-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/John-Hendrickson_avatar-300x300-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/jhendrickson/"><strong>John Hendrickson, Entertainment Channel Manager</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I learned that Bobby was married.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: I was surprised by the amazing resumes of so many people at the Dome (Washington Post, NYT, AP). Quite intimidating!</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mgrisafi/"><strong><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-463 alignright" title="Matt-Grisafi_avatar_1-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Matt-Grisafi_avatar_1-300x3001-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" />Matt Grisafi, Health and Food Channel Manager</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I guess I’ll say I was surprised by John’s ability to identify marginal celebrities in the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: As far as Thunderdome goes, surprised might not be the right word, but I thought it was pretty great just how personable and unassuming everyone was (Ryan aside, haha). Some pretty impressive resumes in the group and opportunities for egos to clash, but I didn’t really see any of that. Pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/mcorones/"><strong><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-464" title="Michael-Corones_avatar-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Michael-Corones_avatar-300x3001-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" />Mike Corones, Technology Channel Manager</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I was pretty surprised that Jeremy is having a daughter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: I was very pleasantly surprised at how effectively features worked together to create initial Entertainment personas.</p>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/author/kmetz/"><strong><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-465" title="Kelly-Metz_avatar-300x300" alt="" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Kelly-Metz_avatar-300x300-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" />Kelly Metz, Features Producer</strong></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about a colleague: I was surprised and found it hysterical that one reason Ryan doesn’t like going to sports games is because he doesn’t like large agreeable crowds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Most surprising about the team: I am surprised and impressed we all got along so well and have the same vision for what Thunderdome is and could be. We all just want to do something to help local newsrooms and we make an exceptional team.</p>
