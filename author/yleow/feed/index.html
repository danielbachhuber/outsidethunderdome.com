<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KarenMeeksPT" target="_blank">Karen Robes Meeks</a>&#8216; &#8220;Boeing C-17&#8243; won the $100 award <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/08/02/august-tout-bout-rules-prizes/">for fantastic videos that were not shot and edited on a mobile device</a>, but were distributed with Tout. This allows for some creative styling and advanced editing that just isn’t as easy on a mobile phone. Meeks, from the Long Beach Press-Telegram, earned 57 percent of the vote with her coverage of Boeing&#8217;s C-17 take-off from Long Beach airport.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-150x150.gif" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tout Bout Logo" /></p><p><img class="alignright  wp-image-3395" alt="Tout Bout Logo" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout.gif" width="180" height="181" /></p>
<p>Thanks to the dozens of Digital First Media journalists who <a title="Enter now for the September Tout Bout" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/09/09/september-tout-bout/" target="_blank">submitted an entry in this month&#8217;s Tout Bout</a>. Our panel has watched them all and selected a new batch of finalists for you to vote on below.</p>
<p>Remember, there are two categories – videos shot with the Tout mobile app and videos that were not shot on mobile, but were distributed with Tout. The finalists for each category were selected based on news value, production quality and, most importantly, creativity. Now it’s up to you to decide which Tout deserves the $200 and $100 prize, respectively. Review the finalist videos below, cast your vote at the bottom, and share your vote with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23toutbout" target="_blank">#ToutBout</a>. The voting deadline is Mon., Sept. 30.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATED 9/30</strong>: Voting is now closed. The winners will be announced this week on Inside Thunderdome.</em></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> After this month&#8217;s Bout, the competition will be held quarterly, rather than monthly. More details to come after we declare this month&#8217;s winners, so stay tuned here at Inside Thunderdome.</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE CATEGORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://twitter.com/cmijs" target="_blank">Catherine Bowen Mijs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrosenbaum" target="_blank">Joel Rosenbaum</a> and <a href="mailto: gtrott@thereporter.com" target="_blank">Greg Trott</a>, The Reporter</strong><br />
&#8220;This Tout from the scene of a 7-alarm fire that destroyed several homes and burned 40 acres in Fairfield on Aug. 27, along with Touts by staff photographers Joel Rosenbaum and Greg Trott, helped us to tell the story in a way that words and still photos just couldn&#8217;t. As we posted each breaking Tout, more and more people began to contact us including all the Bay Area television stations that wanted our footage!&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinMiller1883" target="_blank">Robin Miller</a></p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="https://twitter.com/anchoratfreeman" target="_blank">Paula Mitchell, Daily Freeman<br />
</a></strong>&#8220;This Tout submission includes <a href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2013/08/31/blotter/doc522099e9d5459169277550.txt?viewmode=fullstory" target="_blank">four videos as a package</a> on a tragedy in a small town. Two teens were killed and two others injured in a car accident a week before school began. The boys were on the football team and on their way to a practice. I&#8217;m submitting the package because they appeared on our website long before the story did and covered all angles of the accident from eyewitnesses to school officials. The Daily Freeman had the story long before any other media outlet, and the Touts were the tools we used to get the details out to our readers. The videos were well-viewed, getting thousands of hits as a package. They were shot on location and edited on my iPhone (in my car).&#8221; &#8211; Paula Mitchell</p>

The shooter didn&#8217;t flinch and move away from the action and captures the play long enough for us to catch the receiver diving into the end zone after catching a ball while being tightly defended.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertMeeksPT" target="_blank">Robert Meeks</a></span></p>

<p><strong>NON-MOBILE CATEGORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://twitter.com/cineclark" target="_blank">Clark Coleman, Monterey Herald</a><br />
</strong>&#8220;I am nominating this Tout because it was filmed and edited to tell a cohesive story in 45 seconds. It was used in conjunction with a features story to tease a local film festival. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This Tout stands out among other Touts because more attention was put into the production value.&#8221; &#8211; Clark Coleman</span></p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="https://twitter.com/KarenMeeksPT" target="_blank">Karen Robes Meeks, Long Beach Press-Telegram</a><br />
</strong>&#8220;Boeing Co. senior manager Dave Marendino has worked on the C-17 program since the first military plane took off from its East Long Beach ramp more than 20 years ago. Like many longtime employees, Marendino takes pride in delivering the plane for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions. The recent delivery of the final C-17 to the U.S. Air Force was emotional for many, so Marendino&#8217;s farewell to the plane as it leaves Long Beach for Charleston, S.C. was a bittersweet moment I wanted to capture. Special thanks to Robert Meeks for his help on this video.&#8221; &#8211; Karen Robes Meeks</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-150x150.gif" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tout Bout Logo" /></p><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3395" alt="Tout Bout Logo" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/bout.gif" width="300" height="302" />We received dozens of nominations, and now we have the top finalists for DFM’s August Tout Bout. Remember, we have <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/08/02/august-tout-bout-rules-prizes/">new rules and new prizes</a> this month. There are two categories &#8211; videos shot with the Tout mobile app and videos that were not shot on mobile, but were distributed with Tout. Touts for each category were selected based on relevance/news value, production quality and, most importantly, creativity. Now it’s up to you to decide which Tout deserves the $200 and $100 prize, respectively. Review our talented finalists below, cast your vote at the bottom, and share your vote with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23toutbout" target="_blank">#ToutBout</a>. <strong>The deadline is Friday, August 30.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MOBILE CATEGORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. John McCoy, Los Angeles Daily News</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Funny moment that is interesting because its a mini-interview with a celebrity at a Dodger Game.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_qgetik" src="//www.tout.com/m/qgetik/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>2. Lauren Boyer, York Daily Record</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This Tout turns a totally LAME story about a stadium name change into something more entertaining.</p>
<p>The reporter (that&#8217;s me!) found it hilarious the first time she heard a bank official pronounce &#8220;Santander&#8221; with a super sexy Spanish accent that probably wouldn&#8217;t fly in Pennsylvania Dutch country.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one in York County will be able to pronounce this,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, in the spirit of educating the public, she set out to embarrass herself with this fun tutorial.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_erqush" src="//www.tout.com/m/erqush/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>3. Andrew Edwards, Long Beach Press-Telegram</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In this Tout, I attempted to use a mix of camera angles and movement to give the viewer a sense of where a glass of beer comes from before it is sold at a bar. I also enjoyed the subject&#8217;s description of the beer making process.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_89slb2" src="//www.tout.com/m/89slb2/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>4. <strong>Natalie Alund, Bay Area News Group</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I shot this series of Touts one day after the George Zimmerman verdicts spurred protests across the nation including here in downtown Oakland. Protests got violent and vandalism was abundant. Myself and a colleague &#8211; an Oakland Tribune photographer &#8211; were attacked by vigilantes as we shot these Touts. In the end, we managed to capture the chaos and record history.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_gox9f3" src="//www.tout.com/m/gox9f3/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_wmsxjj" src="//www.tout.com/m/wmsxjj/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_vrka6t" src="//www.tout.com/m/vrka6t/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_awvrwg" src="//www.tout.com/m/awvrwg/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>5. Francesca Shanks, Berkshire Eagle</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Francesca Olsen&#8217;s (@francescashanks) recorded how to make zucchini bacon. It was both thorough and interesting. She demonstrated the process of making the meal with enthusiasm and creativity. It was in association with her In their field column she writes once a week for Berkshires Week, part of The Berkshire Eagle.&#8221; &#8211; Laura Lofgren</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_dmhhc9" src="//www.tout.com/m/dmhhc9/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>6. <strong>Almendra Carpizo, Chico Enterprise-Record</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This is TV-quality video, commentary and editing, all done by our public safety on deadline, using an iPhone, the Tout app and the Lumify app, after a plane crashed nearby, killed two people and starting a brush fire. She just got her new phone out of the box two weeks ago!&#8221; &#8211; David Little</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_tolqc3" src="//www.tout.com/m/tolqc3/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>NON-MOBILE CATEGORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Julio Ojeda-Zapata, St. Paul Pioneer Press</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t #humblebrag too much since I&#8217;m nominating my own video. This is an attempt to portray an unusual tech gadget in a manner that brings out its personality and capabilities. The video aspires to be informative, above all else, but its structure provides suspense (during the first part) and drama (during the second, with an appropriate soundtrack). This is tech journalism with a bit of cinematic flair. Thanks for considering my video.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_8e8m6c" src="//www.tout.com/m/8e8m6c/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. Devon Turchan, The News-Herald</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Snappy editing to the music of a marching band&#8217;s practice showcases the 9th year of the Shaving Cream Showdown. The high school students who&#8217;ve been working hard all week get a chance to lather up and hose off under the hose of the Mentor Fire Department. The video is fast-paced and exciting. You&#8217;ll want to get out the Barbasol and start spraying your co-workers.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_xqib8r" src="//www.tout.com/m/xqib8r/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>3. Jason Halley, Chico Enterprise Record</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This video quickly shot up in the views. Using a GoPro camera I attached to the side of my car to get a third person perspective of what drivers could expect from a new roundabout in a major downtown roadway. It&#8217;s simple and a unique perspective that gave the public a new view of the road work.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed_mdi13t" src="//www.tout.com/m/mdi13t/embed" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>4. Sonya Paclob, York Daily Record</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;At least 206 raw photos are compressed into a 45-second photo sequence. I covered football players in their first week of practice at York Central High School in York, Pa. I had only an hour to cover to move on to my next assignment.</p>
<p>It takes patience and persistence to capture the perfect shots. York Daily Record readers don&#8217;t see the full take, but Tout gives readers exclusive behind the scenes of the journalist.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-150x150.gif" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tout Bout Logo" /></p><p><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/01/kicking-dfms-tout-bout/bout/" rel="attachment wp-att-3395"><img class="size-full wp-image-3395 alignright" alt="Tout Bout Logo" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/bout.gif" width="300" height="302" /></a>It&#8217;s time for round two of Digital First Media&#8217;s monthly Tout Bout! We received some good suggestions from staff about <a title="Fred Robledo Wins July Tout Bout" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/30/fred-robledo-wins-july-tout-bout/">last month&#8217;s Bout</a>, so we&#8217;re mixing things up a bit this time around.</p>
<p>In our inaugural contest, we received a lot of nominations for really creative Touts that were filmed on video cameras and edited for distribution on Tout. Because of the notable differences in available features and quality, we didn&#8217;t feel these videos should compete with those Touts filmed on mobile devices.</p>
<p>With that in mind, there are now two categories for monthly Tout Bout submissions: 1) The most interesting Tout <strong>filmed with a mobile device</strong> and 2) The most interesting Tout <strong>not filmed on a mobile device</strong>. You can select which category your favorite Tout fits into in the nomination form below.</p>
<p>The winner of the most interesting Tout filmed on a mobile device will be awarded $200, and the winner of the most interesting non-mobile Tout will receive $100.</p>
<p>Because the non-mobile videos did not compete in July, those nominees will carry over to this month. The rest of the rules are essentially the same: Nominate your favorite Touts from the last month in the first round, we&#8217;ll narrow it down to the top 10, and then you vote for the winner in each category.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">Remember that individuals can only win the Tout Bout up to three times a year. Reach out to </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" href="mailto:mjenkins@digitalfirstmedia.com">Mandy Jenkins</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem"> or myself (</span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" href="mailto:yleow@digitalfirstmedia.com">Yvonne Leow</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">) if you have any thoughts, suggestions or questions about the contest.</span></p>
<p>So, lace up your gloves and roll your cameras because August&#8217;s Tout Bout officially begins now. Get some ideas by <a title="Tout Bout Finalists: Cast Your Vote by July 26" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/07/22/tout-bout-finalists-cast-vote-july-26/">looking at last month&#8217;s entries</a> and submit your Touts by <strong>Friday, August 16th!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-150x150.gif" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tout Bout Logo" /></p><p><img class="alignright  wp-image-3395" alt="Tout Bout Logo" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-298x300.gif" width="193" height="194" />We received dozens of nominations, and now we have the top ten finalists in DFM&#8217;s monthly Tout Bout. The top ten were selected based on whether they were produced with the app, relevance/news value, production quality and creativity. Now it&#8217;s up to you to decide which Tout deserves the $200 prize. Review our talented finalists, cast your vote at the bottom, and share your vote with the hashtag #ToutBout. The deadline is Friday, July 26.</p>
<p><strong>Gina Dvorak and Canan Tasci, San Gabriel Valley Tribune</strong><br />
&#8220;This Tout works on so many levels. It&#8217;s newsworthy. Los Angeles News Group ran a story about a hoax going on at In-N-Out burger, a Southern California chain with a world-famous cult following. After a fake burger went viral, we reported on how the hoax grew. Then writer Canan Tasci took it to the next level by building a real version of the fake burger. Gina Dvorak may have shot the video; the link is to her Tout account. Tasci has a lot of fun and provides informative instructions on a hot subject in Southern California.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Christopher Ledermuller</em></p>
<p><strong>Mark Jaffe, The Denver Post</strong><br />
&#8220;These touts (7 integrated bits) were part of <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_23573562/xcel-keeps-dead-trees-off-power-lines-lidar">a story package</a> and thanks to our Denver Post Online team were included in a widget along with the text story and some video we acquired.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Mark Jaffe</em></p>
<p><strong>Natalie Alund, Oakland Tribune/Mercury News</strong><br />
&#8220;I shot this Tout on a plane from LAX to SFO one day after being rerouted back to LAX the day Flight 214 crashed in San Francisco. It followed a series of Touts I shot regarding passengers including myself dealing with chaos, fear and uncertainty. The day of the accident, the same plane I was on descended into SFO just minutes before the crash, jerked left and the pilot announced he was turning the plane around to head back to LAX because of the crash. This Tout shows relief of those same passengers who were able to make it finally back safely to SFO the day after the devastating crash.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Natalie Alund</em></p>
<p><strong>Shmuel Thaler, Santa Cruz Sentinel</strong><br />
&#8220;I am nominating this Tout because the photographer used excellent judgement in picking a Tout subject. He didn&#8217;t shoot people sitting in a room talking. He was looking for the action. He opened with narration, which is harder to get people to do than one might think, and he got up close and under a jump. Plus, the finished product ended up being something that added to the story. You can have a still photo of an X Games competitor frozen in the air, or write about how the wind whips past him, but the video gave the readers a quick shot of exactly what it looks like as the rider completes a chain of jumps.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Christina Gullickson</em></p>
<p><strong>Brandie Kessler, York Daily Record/Sunday News</strong><br />
&#8220;This Tout exemplifies the usefulness of the tool.It was pure happenstance that I bumped into a member of Pershing&#8217;s Own, the U.S. Army Band, while I was leaving the York Daily Record&#8217;s satellite office in Gettysburg to cover a Gettysburg 150th event. The band was in Gettysburg to perform for the anniversary. Staff Sgt. Pamela Terry was sitting near the door when I was on my way out, and asked if I had a cell phone charger she could borrow. She was in uniform and I immediately recognized her as a member of Pershing&#8217;s Own (I wrote about them before during the Presidential Inauguration earlier this year.)</p>
<p>As we walked toward the satellite office so I could lend her a charger, I asked her what instrument she played. Turns out she was a vocalist. Actually, she is a soloist! I thought it would be so cool for her to sing something quick for us at the satellite office. She agreed! Beautiful voice, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>Without Tout, and the way it&#8217;s changed my thinking about getting video out to readers ASAP, this glorious tune would not have been. I know it&#8217;s not breaking news, nor did it require any editing, but it&#8217;s gorgeous. I still get chills listening to her sing, just like I did when I heard it in person. I&#8217;m glad others can enjoy this clip, too, thanks to Tout.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Brandie Kessler</em></p>
<p><strong>Jane Tyska, The Oakland Tribune</strong><br />
&#8220;When BART trains stopped running in the Bay Area during the recent strike, impacting thousands of commuters, this story became a talker. Jane brought to life the sights and sounds of the BART strike protest at the Lake Merritt station in Oakland, editing in real time in the phone app and using a variety of different shots to keep the viewer engaged. She was able to then quickly upload to Tout, Twitter and Facebook, all in the space of about one minute. This Tout should win for it&#8217;s creative camera angles and great editing. Thanks for your vote!&#8221;<br />
<em>- Jane Tyska</em></p>
<p><strong>Samantha Dellinger, York Daily Record</strong><br />
&#8220;This Tout was part of a multi platform effort that began with a printed piece in the newspaper. And then was promoted using Tout that pushed it out via Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and also posted it onto my art blog using the Tout Widget. I also engaged our readers by including the name drawing for the winner at the end of my Tout video. A previous Tout video was posted to initially to help promote the contest too. This video was shot using Tout only.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Samantha Dellinger</em></p>
<p><strong>Sonya Paclob, York Daily Record</strong><br />
&#8220;Checking video gear before going out on assignment is crucial. There are so many components and so I did a creative behind the scenes of the York Daily Record newsroom.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Sonya Paclob</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred Robledo, San Gabriel Valley Tribune</strong><br />
&#8220;Since this is the inaugural contest, I&#8217;m nominating a Tout video from high school&#8217;s March Madness in which I captured a dramatic buzzer beater that went viral on the web with over 10,000 views and was picked up and shared by multiple websites. It&#8217;s a shot of Damien&#8217;s Jeremy Hemsley hitting a game-winning basket in the CIF-SS basketball playoffs.&#8221;<br />
<em>- Fred Robledo</em></p>
<p><strong>Zen Vuong, Pasadena Star-News</strong><br />
&#8220;This Tout helps people better visualize the plight people with disabilities face at the South Pasadena Gold Line Station. It adds another layer to the lead character that starts this <a href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_23674238/south-pasadena-gold-line-station-have-another-ramp." target="_blank">article</a>.&#8221;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-150x150.gif" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tout Bout Logo" /></p><p><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/06/28/bout/" rel="attachment wp-att-3395"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3395 alignleft" alt="bout" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/bout-298x300.gif" width="298" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Get your Touts ready because today we kick off the inaugural <b>DFM Tout Bout,</b> a monthly contest for Digital First staffers to nominate and ultimately choose the most creative, interesting or newsworthy Tout.</p>
<p>As Tout has been rolling out across the company, lots of DFMers have been experimenting with the tool and getting some great results. We want to highlight the best Touts out there – as chosen by you.</p>
<p>Nominate a colleague&#8217;s Tout – or your own – using the <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vPnGhHzmrO7GWmDuG8TAjBbA37D0TZHa3GSnM0JAsBc/viewform">form</a> </b>below and get into the running for the monthly prize of $200. After the nomination process, we&#8217;ll narrow down the field to 10, and then YOU will vote for the winning Tout.</p>
<h2><b>The Details</b></h2>
<p><b></b><b>The prize: </b>The creator of the best Tout each month will win $200.</p>
<p><b>How to enter a Tout:</b> Nominate a Tout using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vPnGhHzmrO7GWmDuG8TAjBbA37D0TZHa3GSnM0JAsBc/viewform">form</a> below.</p>
<p><b>Then what? </b>An unbiased group of judges will narrow the nomination to 10 finalists, which will be announced on <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/">Inside Thunderdome</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dfmthunderdome">Twitter</a> on July 22. The monthly winner will be determined by a popular vote.  If you are a finalist, we&#8217;ll let you know via email so you can engage your network in the office and on social media to vote for you.

<p><b>Important dates: </b>Though you can nominate a Tout all month along, nominations close for this month&#8217;s inaugural contest on July 17.</p>
<p>The top 10 finalists will be announced on July 22 and voting on the 10 finalists will run from July 22-26.</p>
<p>The winner for July will be announced on July 30. Then we start it all over again in August.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/01/Photo-on-1-11-13-at-1.23-PM-2-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Thunderdome Video Editor Yvonne Leow" /></p><p>You&#8217;ve already met the <a title="Getting to Know the Thunderdome Operations Team" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2012/11/30/thunderdome-operations-team/">operations</a> and <a title="Nerds Among Nerds: The Thunderdome Data Team" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2012/12/12/nerds-nerds-thunderdome-data-team/">data</a> teams so allow me to introduce the video team. Next month, we&#8217;ll be welcoming a new member to the video team, but more on that later. In the meantime, here&#8217;s a little bit about me and what I do at Project Thunderdome.</p>
<p>My role is to <strong>develop a video strategy</strong> for DFM and to <strong>coordinate video coverage</strong> for our national channels (politics, sports, and the like). This includes streamlining production workflows, standardizing our video CMS, equipment, and software, identifying video partnerships, and helping our papers be more strategic about engaging new audiences and producing higher-quality videos. It&#8217;s not going to happen overnight, but it&#8217;s time we take video to the next level. It&#8217;s time our stories get seen. It&#8217;s time they made an impact. So how do we do it? It begins with leveraging our strengths. We have a lot of talent and expertise at DFM, but we need to start working together. We&#8217;re building a community of visual storytellers across the company, and this is what you can do to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re not on it already, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dfmvideo" target="_blank"><strong>DFM Video google group</strong>.</a> It&#8217;s the best place to swap ideas, ask questions and get feedback from other journos across the country.</li>
<li>Share your thoughts and give us your feedback. <a href="mailto:yleow@digitalfirstmedia.com">E-mail me</a> or post it on the group. Let&#8217;s talk about how we can produce better video journalism because there&#8217;s a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/01/the-cost-of-neutral.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+typepad/sethsmainblog+(Seth's+Blog)" target="_blank">cost to being neutral</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, subscribe to this blog for weekly DFM video updates. In the next post, I&#8217;ll be outlining this year&#8217;s video goals at DFM. You&#8217;ll want to read them.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that being said, who am I? You can read my <a href="http://www.yvonneleow.com/about/" target="_blank">bio</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/yvonneleow" target="_blank">follow me</a> on Twitter, but if you&#8217;re still curious, here are five fun facts about me. (Note: just remember #5.)</p>
<p><strong>Five Fun Facts About DFM&#8217;s Video Editor Yvonne Leow </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://i.picasion.com/pic63/d1c467fbe8ede41d67ae660cafce1fb5.gif" width="300" height="200" />1. <strong>Adventure. </strong>While studying abroad in Shanghai, I spent my birthday traveling to Beichuan, the epicenter of an 8.0 magnitude <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> that struck the region six months before. It took a flight, three bus rides, and a made-up identity to get into the earthquake zone, but it was <a href="http://flic.kr/s/aHsjtphsiT" target="_blank">worth it</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2. <b>Cambodia. </b>My mom is from Cambodia, and my dad is from Singapore. As a result, I&#8217;m a big fan of coconut juice and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian" target="_blank">durian</a> shakes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">3. <strong>AP.</strong> I rarely give them this much credit, but my entertainment internship at the AP headquarters in NYC helped me decide to pursue a career in video journalism. Who wouldn&#8217;t enjoy interviewing Will Smith and watching his movies?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">4. <strong>Startups</strong>. I tried to launch a <a href="http://www.yvonneleow.com/2012/02/23/where-i-go-from-here/" target="_blank">media startup</a> after I left the AP last year. It failed. But I still admire the life of an entrepreneur. It can be soul-crushing at times, but you genuinely fall in love with your work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">5. <strong>Pies. </strong>I&#8217;m a sucker for pies. To me, they&#8217;re better than birthday cake, especially the apple and pumpkin variety.</p>
