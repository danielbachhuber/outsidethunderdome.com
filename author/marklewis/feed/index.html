		<description><![CDATA[The 2013 Columbia University journalism career expo was not unlike a speed-dating event.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/photo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Thunderdome Data Editor Tom Meagher talks with a graduate student Saturday, March 30, at the Columbia University Journalism School Career Expo." /></p><p>The 2013 Columbia University journalism career expo was not unlike a speed-dating event. More than 300 graduate students, all clutching stacks of resumes and clips, cycled through interviews with long tables of potential recruiters. The sounding of a bell signaled the start of each 20-minute round.</p>
<p>This was the first year that Digital First Media had a table at the expo, which makes sense considering that as a company and brand, we are less than two years old. The event ran from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday, March 30, at Columbia University&#8217;s Lerner Hall.</p>
<p>Representing DFM were myself and <a title="Tom Meagher" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/">Tom Meagher</a>, Thunderdome&#8217;s data editor. We met with around 25 journalism graduate students in seven hours. They had a variety of backgrounds, work experience and career aspirations. Most were enrolled in the full-time <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/85-master-of-science-degree/85">Master of Science program</a>, which runs only 10 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s intense,&#8221; said Ryan Book, 24, a print major due to graduate in late May. &#8220;They have you covering beats and turning in stories. When Sandy happened we were out there the next day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Compared to going to school, looking for a job is quite fun,&#8221; he added.</p>
<div id="attachment_2415" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2415" alt="More than 300 Columbia University Journalism School masters students met with dozens of potential recruiters Saturday, March 30, at the school's annual career expo. " src="/content/uploads/2013/04/photo1-1024x768.jpg" width="625" height="468" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">More than 300 Columbia University Journalism School masters students met with dozens of potential recruiters Saturday, March 30, at the school&#8217;s annual career expo.</p></div>
<p>Kaitlyn Wells, a print major from Houston, Texas, credited the school&#8217;s career services office with helping her prepare. Like many of her fellow students, she had enlisted their help to write her resume and had also taken advantage of interview coaching opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was extremely nervous but when I&#8217;m in the interview, I&#8217;m casual,&#8221; Wells said, adding that career services had advised her to &#8220;be comfortable and professional so you don&#8217;t get nervous and forget what to say. Have those answers in your back pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom and I each left with an armful of resumes and clips, which we&#8217;ll circulate with DFM&#8217;s editorial leadership. It was a long, exhausting day but we were both excited to meet so many talented and ambitious journalists. If their work is any indication, the next generation of journalists will be as impressive as any that have come before them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the tragic events at Sandy Hook, the Digital First Media team came together to discuss best practices for national coverage and generate a document to guide future efforts.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/photo1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="photo[1]" /></p><p>When I first heard the news of the Sandy Hook tragedy I was sitting on a hotel balcony in Negril, Jamaica. It was the second day of a long-awaited vacation. Already my inbox showed hundreds of emails as Thunderdome and DFM newsrooms mobilized to cover this heartbreaking story.</p>
<p>By the time I returned a few days later we had dozens of journalists assigned to coverage, roughly 35 of which came from other DFM newsrooms, including The Denver Post. We had set up a remote newsroom and were coordinating the sharing of content across our national network of newsrooms.</p>
<p>My colleague Steve Buttry, Digital First Media’s director of digital transformation, gave <a title="Sandy Hook Coverage Shows Scope of Digital First Teamwork" href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/2013/02/11/sandy-hook-coverage-shows-scope-digital-teamwork/">a more thorough accounting of Newtown coverage</a> in a recent post.</p>
<p>This was the first time Thunderdome had partnered with newsrooms on this scale to cover a national event. We immediately began an internal discussion on how to learn from this experience and apply those lessons to future newsroom collaborations.</p>
<p>“We have tried to make introspection and analysis a key component of Thunderdome,” said Robyn Tomlin, editor of Thunderdome. “We recognized early on that this would be an incredible opportunity to learn – from our successes and our mistakes.”</p>
<p>Based on the size and complexity of this project, we separated our approach into three phases. The first was to gather online survey data from our three primary groups of participants. This would give us a foundation of data from which we could begin to identify positive and negative themes.</p>
<p><strong>Thunderdome staff</strong> – We had approximately a dozen staff participate in coverage. This included reporting and editing, as well as coordination and sharing of content.</p>
<p><strong>Visiting DFM journalists</strong> – This group was of special importance as they were dropped into an unfamiliar newsroom and would have a unique view of operations.</p>
<p><strong>Network editors</strong> – We used existing protocols to begin sharing content just moments after the story broke, but the nature and volume of content was unprecedented.</p>
<div id="attachment_1775" style="width: 444px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-1775" alt="screenshot of survey" src="http://tdcms.dfmops.com/content/uploads/2013/02/screenshot-of-survey.png" width="434" height="250" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One way we gathered feedback after the fact was through a SurveyMonkey questionnaire sent to journalists who had used or participated in coverage.</p></div>
<p>The survey information proved invaluable and participants were eager to contribute to this process. Almost immediately key themes began to surface and we compiled these into nine ‘challenge areas.’</p>
<p>Our next step was to gather Thunderdome staff to discuss each ‘challenge area’ and document suggestions on how they could be fixed. We lined the walls of our conference room with large sheets of paper, with a ‘challenge area’ at the top of each.</p>
<div id="attachment_1773" style="width: 447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-1773" alt="screenshot of conf room2" src="http://tdcms.dfmops.com/content/uploads/2013/02/screenshot-of-conf-room2.jpg" width="437" height="328" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Another shot of the conference room during our staff discussion.</p></div>
<p>We’d budgeted one hour for this meeting but it ended up taking two-and-a-half. By the end everyone had contributed and we had at least partial consensus on all issues.</p>
<p>“Was it perfect and problem-free coverage? Of course not, and the real satisfaction is learning from our mistakes and trying to figure out how we can be better journalists next time,” said Troy Turner, news channels editor for Thunderdome. “ That truly defines the spirit and dedication of what this team’s about.”</p>
<p>Our next step was to condense this into a final report we could submit to our regional editorial leadership for approval. We built this on the previously identified ‘challenge areas’ and provided a checklist of action items for each. Our goal was to create a reference manual editors can refer to when national news breaks in their community.</p>
<div id="attachment_1774" style="width: 445px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-1774" alt="screenshot of final report" src="http://tdcms.dfmops.com/content/uploads/<br /><p class="wp-caption-text">2013/02/screenshot-of-final-report.png" width="435" height="164" /> The national coverage guidelines that resulted from our experience at Sandy Hook will be used by DFM newsrooms to guide future responses to breaking news situations.</p></div>
<p>We are now distributing copies of this completed and approved report to all DFM newsrooms. This was a challenging story for any news organization to cover. Our hope is that by learning from this experience we can continue to improve how we work together to create quality journalism, no matter where the story breaks.</p>

Who are you guys? What exactly do you do all day? You can find a lot of that information on the <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-are/">who we are page</a> of this blog, but I also wanted to personally introduce my team, which handles operations and communications.</p>
<p>We are the only Thunderdome team that doesn&#8217;t produce content. Our role is to provide the systems and support that allow other teams, and the talented journalists at Digital First Media, to perform at their best. Have questions for us? Please let us know in the comments.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch/">Chris March, Mission Control</a></strong><br />
<strong>Describe your average work day:</strong> As you might imagine, it’s a bit of fun to explain a title like <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2012/11/30/thunderdome-operations-team/chris-march_avatar-300x300-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-574"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-574" title="Chris-March_avatar-300x300" alt="Chris March mugshot" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Chris-March_avatar-300x3002.jpeg" width="300" height="300" /></a>‘Mission Control’ to friends and colleagues. But the job is actually quite simple in that I help the new Thunderdome staff integrate into the Digital First Media world by providing operational support and communications. I like to think of myself as a guy who can help connect the dots.</p>
<p>Because we are still in process of building our content channels, forming relationships and constructing our workflows, a large chunk of my day consists of procuring stories of national interest from our local newsrooms or content partners and distributing those to editors across the Digital First network. There is a good deal of coordination with our channel managers, DFM editors and content partners to make sure everything falls into place. It’s a bit like running our own Digital First wire service, but it’s more of a temporary solution until we have easier ways to get these stories onto the websites and print pages of our newsrooms so they can focus more on local.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though, the role of Mission Control is to make sure Thunderdome succeeds in a way that benefits Digital First newsrooms. As Thunderdome continues to grow and evolve, so to will the Mission Control desk. And that’s pretty exciting for me.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get started in journalism?</strong> It would be easy to point fingers at my parents, who are both editors at two different Journal Register Company newspapers. Because of them, I had to sit in on page one news meetings before I could even tie my shoes. But I’m not giving them byline credit on my journalism story.</p>
<p>I stumbled into journalism by accident after they both tried steering me into other careers. I had my sights set on computers until I started writing and publishing newsletters (print and online!) for my 11th grade cross country team, which I was captain of.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall why I wrote that first newsletter, but that was the rabbit hole for me. The team read it, passed it around, talked about it, analyzed it and asked for more. It created discussions and strengthened bonds. It was amateur writing and hardly journalism, but I recognized it immediately as a social tool I could use to build our little community. Call it love at first write.</p>
<p>This blew up the notion of journalism for me into something else. It was more than fact-based accounting of events and local politics. I began to see it as something I could use to help us understand and explain why we ran through fields of cow manure in the rain and snow together (and obviously, something like that does need explaining). It was something I could use to tell our story, even if it was interesting to only a few of us. Once I turned that light on, I couldn’t turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about journalism?</strong> Sure, there’s an appeal to being a watchdog for your readers, tilting spotlights on corruption and keeping a record of the times. But the appeal of journalism to me is that drive to cut beneath the surface and into the nerve of something. What I love is the quest for truth and answers. Why do certain things happen as they do? Why do certain things appeal to a culture when others don’t? What drives us to do what we do? Why is something good or bad? What makes us tick? What brings us joy?</p>
<p>I recently watched ‘The Rum Diary,’ which was based on the Hunter S. Thompson novel he wrote in his early twenties. There’s a line at the end that nails it for me.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I want to make a promise to you, the reader. And I don’t know if I can fulfill it tomorrow, or even the day after that. But I put the bastards of this world on notice that I do not have their best interests at heart. I will try and speak for my reader. That is my promise. And it will be a voice made of ink and rage.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is something about you that most people don&#8217;t know?</strong> I made front page news as a second grader. A toddler from my neighborhood went missing from his home one day in November. A massive search effort was launched with fire engines, helicopters and scuba divers swarming the neighborhood by the time I got home from school. But he was just out of the search zone, hanging around in the woods at my house when I saw him. I got my dad, and we drove him to the rescuers. He was barefoot when we found him, so I gave him a pair of my awesomely 80’s tube socks. I was interviewed by the local papers, received some nice letters and was presented with an award from the Pennsylvania State Police in front of the entire 2nd grade. But I never got those tube socks back.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/arhinehart/">Andy Rhinehart, Solutions Specialist</a></strong><br />
<strong>Describe your average work day:</strong> My average day is spent pursuing ways to help maximize <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2012/11/30/thunderdome-operations-team/andy-rhinehart_avatar-300x300/" rel="attachment wp-att-575"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-575" title="Andy-Rhinehart_avatar-300x300" alt="Andy Rhinehart mugshot" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Andy-Rhinehart_avatar-300x300.jpeg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Thunderdome’s value to our newsrooms. That could mean working with vendors on products to help grow audience and revenue, diving into our analytics to tackle the challenge of tracking how and where Thunderdome content is being used or investigating new ways of structuring our data to create new and exciting products.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get started in journalism?</strong> Senior year in high school. I happened to stop by one of our baseball games one late spring afternoon, a rarity since my graduating class featured perhaps the worst group of male athletes to ever step upon campus. In the crowd I saw a family friend, and when I stopped to chat, he introduced me to the man sitting next to him &#8211; the sports editor of the local tri-weekly paper. In the course of conversation, my friend mentioned that the sports editor was looking for a stringer for the summer. I happened to be looking for a summer job, one thing led to another and soon I was that stringer, covering my first game the night after my high school graduation. I already had plans to attend a college and study electrical engineering, but it didn’t take long before I knew journalism would instead be my career choice.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about journalism?</strong> Collecting and sharing information has always been a passion; it’s one reason why I embraced digital many years ago and still love working with online today. I also enjoy tackling the ‘why’ of the five W&#8217;s. Be it looking at education data and population trends to help answer why school populations are surging in a certain area or tracking all plays for a professional football team over the course of a season to answer why they’re so successful on certain downs, I think answering the why is one of the best services we can provide as journalists.</p>
<p><strong>What is something about you that most people don&#8217;t know?</strong> I love football at all levels, from high school to the NFL, and have been an avid fantasy football player for more than 20 years, running a league that began as a group of newsroom co-workers. In addition to NFL leagues, I’ve taken part in fantasy football leagues for high school football, the XFL and Arena League football. Lately, I’ve become a huge fan of cricket, which I realize is an odd choice for someone born and raised in the mountains of North Carolina.</p>

I scan <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2012/11/30/thunderdome-operations-team/davis-shaver_avatar-300x300/" rel="attachment wp-att-576"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-576" title="Davis-Shaver_avatar-300x300" alt="Davis Shaver mugshot" src="/content/uploads/2012/11/Davis-Shaver_avatar-300x300-300x284.jpeg" width="300" height="284" /></a>for nationally relevant stories that may have been shared overnight by Thunderdome or other outlets in the Digital First Media network. As a member of the Mission Control team, I help distribute these stories across the network. In addition to my Mission Control responsibilities, I also help manage InsideThunderdome.com, our home for news and information about Thunderdome.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get started in journalism?</strong> I began my career in journalism stringing for the <a href="http://www.ldnews.com" target="_blank">Lebanon Daily News</a>, which is now a Digital First Media publication. Those early freelance stories weren&#8217;t glamorous — township and municipality meetings rarely are — but they taught me how to write on deadline.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about journalism?</strong> What I love about being in the journalism industry right now is the confluence of peril and promise. As the manner in which we produce and consume news continues to change, there are enormous opportunities for those who stay true to their mission of informing the public while also not being afraid to radically change the ways in which they accomplish that goal. I am truly bullish on the future of the industry.</p>
<p><strong>What is something about you that most people don&#8217;t know?</strong> Something most people might not know about me is that I would love to one day be headmaster of a boarding school. I attribute the dream to one of America&#8217;s great long-form journalists, John McPhee, whose book &#8216;The Headmaster&#8217; also inspired me to spend a gap-year in Jordan working at King&#8217;s Academy (known also as Deerfield in the desert).</p>

<strong>Excerpt of an email sent by Digital First Media editor-in-chief Jim Brady to all newsrooms:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>To those not familiar with the DFMies, we will be awarding one winner every month in each of our eight groups of papers — Bay Area News Group, Los Angeles News Group, Northern California, Texas/New Mexico, Colorado/Utah, Midwest (MN/MI/OH), New York/New England and Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia. The winners will receive $250 net. If you want to know more about the DFMies, feel free to contact Steve Buttry, who is managing the DFMies, or one of the regional editors, who are responsible for gathering entries and picking finalists. For this first effort, the contest judges were Thunderdome staffers. Going forward, the judges will be the winners from the previous month.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, here are the winners for the inaugural DFMies:</p>
<p><strong>Larry Altman</strong> of the Daily Breeze won in LANG, our Southern California cluster, for a story that was three years in the making, the <a href="http://storify.com/tsciacqua/david-viens-case" target="_blank">murder conviction of restaurant owner David Viens</a>. The story started in November 2009, but counts as a September story because that was when Viens was convicted, after which the prosecutor thanked Larry for his dogged reporting that prompted the investigation that led to Viens&#8217; murder conviction. Investigating a missing person report, Larry followed his suspicions, worked sources and stayed on the story, confronting Viens at his restaurant six months after his wife disappeared. Eventually his reporting prompted the killer to confess to his girlfriend and attempt suicide. When word came out in the September trial that Viens had confessed to police that he had boiled his wife’s entire body in water in his restaurant and disposed of her liquefied remains, Larry broke the news in a <a href="https://twitter.com/LarryAltman/statuses/248162627212177408" target="_blank">tweet</a> from the courtroom.</p>
<p>Other LANG finalists were <strong>Paul Penzella</strong> and <strong>Philip Lawrence</strong> for the design of LANG&#8217;s 2012 College Football iPad app and Brian Charles for reporting into alleged malfeasance in the Pasadena Police Department.</p>
<p><strong>Evan Brandt</strong> of the Pottstown Mercury won the DFMie for the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster for his reporting that forced the resignation of Pottstown School Superintendent Reed Lindley. <a href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/20120920/NEWS01/120919402/pottstown-high-school-assembly-think-and-grow-rich-draws-fire" target="_blank">Evan&#8217;s reporting on the &#8220;Think and Grow Rich&#8221; assembly speaker</a> grew from noticing some community buzz on Facebook, crowdsourcing on Facebook to learn what was said at the assembly and documenting costs to the taxpayers of $28,000. <a href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/20120921/NEWS01/120929898/reed-lindley-resigns-as-pottstown-schools-superintendent" target="_blank">Lindley</a> resigned the next day.</p>
<p>Other finalists from the PA/NJ/WV cluster were <strong>Brian Hall</strong> and <strong>Marcus Rauhut</strong> of the Chambersburg Public Opinion for multimedia coverage of a school dress code controversy and <strong>Kathleen Carey</strong> of the Delaware County Daily Times for a series on the closing of two oil refineries.</p>
<p>In the Northern California cluster, <strong>J.M. Brown</strong> and <strong>Kevin Johnson</strong> of the Santa Cruz Sentinel won for a six-month investigation of a seawater desalination facility in Santa Cruz. J.M. interviewed more than 60 water officials, scientists, utility customers and others to provide a deep look inside the financial, environmental and political implications of the city&#8217;s plan. Brown and Johnson traveled throughout California&#8217;s Central Coast to capture the impacts of desalination, travels that produced four online videos that further illustrate what&#8217;s at stake. The <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/desal" target="_blank">three-day series</a> included 12 stories and a host of photographs, documenting the numerous risks associated with building the controversial plant and weighing alternatives.</p>
<p>Other NorCal finalists were <strong>James Herrera</strong> and <strong>Clark Coleman</strong> of the Monterey Herald for their videos as part of &#8220;The Seven Wonders of Monterey County&#8221; and <strong>Lanz Christian Bañes</strong> for initiating and leading the Vallejo Times-Herald&#8217;s daily Our Town photo contest.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Kirby</strong> and <strong>Ivan Lajara</strong> of the Daily Freeman in Kingston, N.Y., shared the New York/New England cluster&#8217;s DFMie for their <a href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2012/09/21/news/doc505bc6a92d41a166113459.txt" target="_blank">live coverage of a hospital merger hearing</a>. The controversial proposal &#8212; to merge to non-profit hospitals, one secular and one Catholic, and close one of the campuses &#8212; had generated years of conflict centering on abortion. Paul and Ivan covered the evening forum (with a 9:15 deadline for last print page) with a package of live-stream video, separate wrap-up video, live tweets, community participation via Twitter and Storify.</p>
<p>Other New York/New England finalists were <strong>Robert Mills</strong> of the Lowell Sun for his coverage of a quadruple shooting and <strong>Daniela Forte</strong> of the Litchfield County Times for her story on an unsolved murder.</p>
<p><strong>Julia Lyon</strong> and <strong>Trent Nelson</strong> of the Salt Lake Tribune won the DFMie for the Colorado/Utah cluster for <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/" target="_blank">Bittersweet Surrender</a>, a project on Utah families surrendering custody of children with autism so the state would pay for their care (Utah doesn&#8217;t require insurance companies to cover treatment). Julia spent months reporting, starting with the challenge of locating families willing to tell their stories and give her access to to their child welfare files. Her stories, with photography by Trent, introduced readers to two young boys surrendered by their families and showed the impact of a lack of affordable care.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Magan</strong> and <strong>Jean Pieri</strong> of the St. Paul Pioneer Press won the Midwest DFMie for their coverage of a <a href="http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_21655126/minneapolis-shooting-is-deadliest-incident-workplace-violence-minnesotas?source=pkg" target="_blank">deadly Minneapolis workplace attack</a>. The contest is limited to work by just one or two journalists, but Chris&#8217;s story and Jean&#8217;s photos were part of a larger package that included outstanding <a href="http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_21646940/bryn-mawr-minneapolis-shooting-kills-several?IADID=Search-www.twincities.com-www.twincities.com" target="_blank">digital and print coverage</a> by a team of Pioneer Press and TwinCities.com staffers. The nomination from Editor Mike Burbach said, &#8220;It was a lesson in everyone taking part in the information gathering and sharing so we could work more quickly than our competition, which relies on reporters alone to do such things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other Midwest finalists were Macomb Daily stringer <strong>Harry Arnold</strong>, who used a remote-control drone with a camera to cover the unsuccessful search for Jimmy Hoffa&#8217;s remains and the <strong>Monica Drake</strong> of the Oakland Press, who used community engagement to tell how 9/11 affected readers.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Peele</strong> won the Bay Area News Group DFMie for building a database of public employee salaries and benefits, a two-year project. As the state considered reform of public employee pensions, Tom showed the impact and identified the officials who received pensions topping $200,000. With the local police chief announcing his retirement, Tom showed how <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/pensions/ci_21608920/double-dippers-rake-public-money" target="_blank">he and others were able to double-dip</a>, taking a second public job while collecting pensions from their first jobs. The double-dip story drew 17,000 page views and the interactive databases of <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/salaries/pensions" target="_blank">public pensions</a> and <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/salaries" target="_blank">salaries</a> got another 10,000.</p>
<p>Other BANG finalists were <strong>Julia Prodis Sulik</strong> and <strong>Erin Ivie</strong> for their coverage of the space shuttle Endeavor&#8217;s flyover in the San Francisco Bay area and business columnist Mike Cassidy&#8217;s &#8220;Made in the Bay Area&#8221; series.</p>
<p>El Paso Times reporter <strong>Marty Schladen</strong> won the Texas/New Mexico DFMie for <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_21538461/city-delays-el-paso-times-building-purchase?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com" target="_blank">his coverage of a controversial plan for the city to buy the El Paso Times building as a new location for City Hall</a>. The purchase is part of a broader controversial effort to demolish City Hall to clear the way for a Triple A baseball stadium. As the City Council was preparing to finalize the purchase of the Times building for $14 million, Times journalists obtained the city’s appraisal of the building and discovered the appraised value was $3.7 million below the purchase price. City officials hadn’t really read the appraisal until Times reporter started asking about it. Although the discovery risked costing the company several million dollars, the Times broke the story and has continued to follow the issue.</p>
<p>Other Tex/Mex finalists were <strong>Steve Ramirez</strong> and <strong>Diana Alba</strong> of the Las Cruces Sun-News for their coverage of the Endeavour flyover and <strong>Jim Kavelage</strong> of the Ruidoso News for the bizarre story of a woman who was killed when a golf cart driven by a 5-year-old boy flipped over.</p></blockquote>
