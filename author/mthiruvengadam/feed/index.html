		<description><![CDATA[Years after interning with the Salt Lake Tribune, Meena Thiruvengadam returns to Digital First Media as business channel manager.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Meena-and-Brooke-Adams-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Meena Thiruvengadam with Salt Lake Tribune mentor Brooke Adams. (File)" /></p><p>I started my journalism career as an intern at a Digital First Media property – The Salt Lake Tribune – and that&#8217;s part of why I wanted to join Thunderdome. My experience in Salt Lake City prepared me to seize opportunities and cover some amazing stories around the world.</p>
<p>In the years since my internship, I&#8217;ve written about everything from murders and mayhem on the streets of San Antonio to the Federal Reserve, the European financial crisis and the Northern Lights in Iceland. I&#8217;ve developed a love for the pace and scope of news wires, an appreciation of the local communities newspapers serve and a desire to help make the news product more meaningful to its consumers. Thunderdome gives me a unique opportunity to serve all of those interests at once.</p>
<p>As business channel manager, I get to keep my eye on big national stories while serving local audiences and developing an innovative news product. It&#8217;s like I get to have my cake and eat it too. And the fact that I&#8217;ll be working to help the paper that gave me my start develop even stronger business coverage is the icing on that cake.</p>
