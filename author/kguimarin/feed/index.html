				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/BIGDATA-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="BIGDATA" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the eighth in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Data, data, data.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Do you tremble with fear at the sight of that word?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The very thought of crunching numbers and analyzing rows of data is enough to send many journalists running for the hills. My advice? Don’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Yes, data can be overwhelming. Numbers can be scary. But it’s time we show the numbers who’s boss. Thanks to the advancements of the digital age, data tools and numbers have become so much easier to manage. If we face our data fears, we can tell some really compelling stories.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">I attended the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UoG_UpQ4W4E" target="_blank">Big Data, Little Newsroom</a> session at ONA13 for a couple reasons. I too begin sweating bullets when someone says it’s time to open up a spreadsheet and look at some numbers. As a journalist, I thought this was  a good opportunity to challenge myself and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This low-key session was led by <a href="https://twitter.com/CarewGrovum">Emma Carew Grovum</a>, special projects researcher at <a href="http://philanthropy.com/section/Home/172/">The Chronicle of Philanthropy</a>, and was directed at smaller newsrooms with bigger aspirations. I found the session was as much about learning a new skill — data — as it was about working as a team.</span></p>
<p>If you have yet to take the plunge into the world of data journalism, here are three key points to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every story can be a data story</strong></li>
<li><strong>Every journalist can be a data journalist</strong></li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Every newsroom can produce kick-ass data projects</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">In addition to that, k</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">now your goals and know your audience when you take on a data project. Ask yourself w</span>hat you want to convey? What do you hope to accomplish? Once you have your vision, it&#8217;s time to roll up your sleeves and get busy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. Identify obstacles<br />
</span></strong>Ok, so now you have your idea. But what obstacles are in your way? We all have them. From finding the data, to crunching the numbers, to technology and knowledge, or making the pitch to your editor. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Here are some common examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is &#8220;dirty&#8221;</li>
<li>Story lacks focus</li>
<li>Too many moving pieces</li>
<li>Breaking news or daily news monopolizes time</li>
<li>Lack of coordination</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Data is <em>still</em> dirty</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">How do you get past these obstacles? Know what you could be up against and plan your attack. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Get into a “data state of mind” and get the ideas flowing.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We all have ideas, and those ideas can come from anywhere. But in a small newsroom, as Grovum pointed out, they should come from <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. Choose skills over tools<br />
</span></strong>Start with skills — who knows what? Use the known skills to jumpstart or aid the process, <em>then</em> identify the tools. As the projects begin to flow, pick a few tools and stick with them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">3. Think visually<br />
</span></strong>Let’s show our audience what we’ve got by coming up with a way to display the content that is useful. I’m currently experimenting with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, an interactive map tool. At first attempt, it seems fairly user-friendly. Other recommendations include <a href="http://piktochart.com/">Piktochart</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Fusion Tables</a> and <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4. Data every day<br />
</span></strong>Ask questions related to data. Think about the details that can help your coverage. The more data you have from the start, the easier the ideas will flow.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">5. Stay organized<br />
</span></strong>Use <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> to manage your time, meetings and deadlines. Or t<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">ry <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>. I created an account following this session and have been experimenting with it since. A great organizing and communicating tool, especially when working on projects that include multiple departments or newsrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>6. Always be learning</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s not forget that we are journalists. It&#8217;s safe to assume many of us got into this business because we want to learn more and ask questions. Look at data journalism and digital tools like this: New tools, new skills, new knowledge = more fun, more journalism. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">One thing that Grovum said during the session has stuck with me. She said, “On every data project someone should always be learning.” </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">How important is data to digital journalism right now? I believe this tweet from my colleague Daniel Tedford sums it up best: </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>If i could describe <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ONA13&amp;src=hash">#ONA13</a> &#8211; my first &#8211; in 3 words, they would be: Data, data and data</p>
<p>— Daniel Tedford (@dgtedford) <a href="https://twitter.com/dgtedford/statuses/391738477949517826">October 20, 2013</a></p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">Salt-N-Pepa. Cat gifs. Cronuts. Ryan Gosling. PB&amp;J.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Looking for a common theme? </span>Each of these items made an appearance in some form or another at <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/fasttrack-video-1/#.UnQ2XJRgaPs" target="_blank">ONA13&#8242;s Fast Track Video Workshop</a>, which I attended.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">With a focus on long-form video, the techniques I learned about in this session can help improve the <a href="http://www.tout.com/u/kimguim" target="_blank">Touts</a> and other video projects we produce from our newsrooms across Digital First Media. </span>I&#8217;m no pro when it comes to video, but I am excited to begin applying what I learned from this workshop. H<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">ere are the 7 tips that can take our video game to the next level (pun intended):</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. Remember the &#8216;Rule of Thirds&#8217;<br />
</span></strong>Just like when taking a good photo, the focal point of each video shot should be on a grid based on thirds.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. Do not cross the line of action<br />
</span></strong>The line of action is the line of action — do not cross it. Keep the camera on one side of the subject.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Capture <a href="http://video.digitalnewsroom.org/index.php/onepager-five-shot-video-checklist/">5 key shots</a> for every video</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Closeup of the hands — What is the subject doing?</li>
<li>Closeup of the face — Be in their face</li>
<li>Wide shot — Set the scene with the environment shot</li>
<li>Over the shoulder — Get the subject’s point-of-view</li>
<li>Unusual or alternative angle — What else should the audience know?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4. Hold for 10 seconds<br />
</span></strong>Ten seconds is just that — 10 seconds. Hold each shot for 10 seconds, which allows footage that can be edited out. But remember to keep the camera steady.</p>
<p>Need help keeping your camera steady? Buy a tripod. Even a cheap one will help with stability. <a href="http://video.digitalnewsroom.org/index.php/onepager-video-field-equipment/">Being equipped correctly is important.</a></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">5. Audio is extremely important<br />
</span></strong>Audio is key. Be aware of background noise. What good is an interview if you can’t hear what someone is saying?</p>
<p>Invest in earphones or earbuds and use them.</p>
<p>And if possible, a separate mic is always better. If you have one that you can use, it&#8217;s important that you remain in control of it. Do not let the subject hold it.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="http://video.digitalnewsroom.org/index.php/onepager-audio-checklist-for-video/">extra tips</a> straight from the source.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">6. Interviewing<br />
</span></strong>Many of us think we’ve got this, and many of us do. But remember that interviews take a very different dynamic on camera than they do with a notebook. Here are some pointers for recording video interviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from yes/no questions. Ask open-ended questions. Long questions are good. Description is good.</li>
<li>Smile and nod to engage with the subject while they are talking. But avoid any oohs and aaahs, as those are difficult to edit out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. And this is the most important part</strong><br />
Ultimately, have fun while doing it.</p>
