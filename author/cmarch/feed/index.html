		<description><![CDATA[This month's Thunderdome MVP honor goes to sports editor Gary Kicinski for his leadership of Digital First Media's 2014 Olympics coverage.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300" /></p><p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7603" alt="Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Gary-Kicinski_avatar_1380631196-300x300.jpeg" width="300" height="300" /></a>If a gold medal were to be given out for <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/05/expansive-winter-olympics-coverage-digital-media-websites/" target="_blank">Digital First Media&#8217;s national coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics</a>, we&#8217;d have to give it to the guy who led the show: Thunderdome sports editor <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/gkicinski/" target="_blank">Gary Kicinski</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no such gold medal, so Gary will have to settle for this month&#8217;s Thunderdome MVP/Under the Radar award. It&#8217;s not as shiny, but it does come with a $5 Starbucks gift card.</p>
<p>The Thunderdome Olympics desk received recognition earlier this month, winning <a title="Thunderdome’s 24/7 Olympics desk earns the cross-team gold" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/03/04/thunderdomes-247-olympics-desk-earns-cross-team-gold/" target="_blank">Thunderdome&#8217;s cross-team collaboration award</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The nomination</strong>: Thunderdome’s MVP is voted on each month by a panel of anonymous judges. Anyone can be nominated by anyone on staff. Gary was nominated for the award by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwalks" target="_blank">sports producer Matt Walks</a>, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>On behalf of the team that tackled the Olympics, I just wanted to take a second to nominate Gary for MVP because of the way he made such a daunting event easy (and fun) to cover literally all hours of the day. Juggling the needs of all of our properties wasn&#8217;t easy, nor was making sure we producers didn&#8217;t lose our sanity. From Mission Control to Kelly and both Chrises, it was truly a team effort, but we couldn&#8217;t have done what we did without Gary.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The other nominees</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jsederholm" target="_blank"><strong>Jillian Sederholm</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/phogan" target="_blank">Patrick Hogan</a>, who said: &#8220;When the news came out that Facebook was adding more gender options, we originally were going to wait for an official list to come out. It was Jillian who discovered how to get Facebook to display the list in profile options and who <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-living/ci_25134487/here-are-facebooks-56-gender-identity-options" target="_blank">got the list out while</a> everyone else was still reporting the original announcement.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/kmetz" target="_blank"><strong>Kelly Metz</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/marklewis" target="_blank">Mark Lewis</a>, who said: &#8220;Kelly is definitely worthy of this honor. She&#8217;s been helping me capture feeds for NewsCred, and as always she&#8217;s the type who doesn&#8217;t mind carrying water to support a project. She&#8217;s hardworking and has exactly the type of personality and work ethic we should be presenting to our newsrooms. Bonus points for being a self-starter and consistently exceeding expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwagner" target="_blank"><strong>Meg Wagner</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jglenza" target="_blank">Jessica Glenza</a>, who said: &#8220;She gets to Thunderdome at the crack of dawn, makes sure our pages look fresh and does an amazing job turning breaking news into rich, original content. As we all know, she also writes <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/tag/headlines" target="_blank">amazing headlines</a> and is always willing to help. Also, she looks stylish doing it. Thanks Meg, for all you do!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu" target="_blank"><strong>Nelson Hsu</strong></a> was nominated by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch" target="_blank">Chris March</a>. I said: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m the first person to nominate Nelson for Serendipity Day. Everyone who didn&#8217;t nominate him now owes the contest committee a Starbucks card. No excuses. Not only was this idea a perfect venture for Thunderdome, but the prep, organization and execution of it was super smooth. Our normal operations continued without fail while staff from all departments collaborated on some really awesome ideas that can and will have many use cases. And it appears that everyone who participated in something, learned something. That&#8217;s two birds with one stone, and Nelson threw the stone here. Bravo to his leadership and organization for seeing this through.</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/kworkman" target="_blank"><strong>Karen Workman</strong></a> was nominated by Patrick Hogan, who said: &#8220;&#8230; and the rest of the breaking news team, but mostly Karen. Karen took the chaos of a month&#8217;s worth of updates on what&#8217;s happening in Ukraine and <a href="http://dfm-master.cms.newscred.com/article/searching-for-a-diplomatic-solution-in-ukraine-and-other-updates/7c5634cfe0d24c2b895bb042a0499566" target="_blank">distilled it into a format</a> that was both very informative but also creative and engaging.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwalks/"><strong>Matt Walks</strong></a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/rmaghielse" target="_blank"><strong>Ross Maghielse</strong></a> were co-nominated by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/chopkins" target="_blank">Chris Hopkins</a>, who said: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to submit for recognition Matt Walks and Ross Maghielse, who for more than two weeks utterly demolished their Circadian rhythms in service of Digital First Media&#8217;s Olympics coverage. First one worked a 4 p.m. to midnight shift while the other worked a midnight to 8 a.m. shift, then they traded. I&#8217;ve worked some pretty weird hours during my career and even I&#8217;ve never been on the clock between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Thing to know this week</b>: Since Gary already provided some Olympics-related advice while accepting the cross-team collaboration award, he has a more general tip to share this week.</p>
<blockquote><p>Go back and check your published link!</p>
<p>It seems obvious, but too often we fail to go back and see what our published story looks like on the Web after we&#8217;ve published an article. It is easy to forget to do when sometimes it takes 15 minutes or more to show up and you&#8217;ve already moved on to another article.</p>
<p>But the reasons to do so are many, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might catch an error that wasn&#8217;t apparent to you in the editing environment.</li>
<li>You might notice a display issue that could not be presented in the preview mode (such as a byline problem, secondary photo issue, sidebar or promo box problem, etc.)</li>
<li>You might discover the publishing system is down if your article doesn&#8217;t even show up!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/20140304__0305joebell3-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="WWII veteran, Joe Bell, 95, became a viral video Internet sensation after Mercury News writer Julia Prodis-Sulek posted a Tout video of the spontaneous tributes Bell received while he stood in front of his home cheering on participants during the annual Pat Tillman running race. (Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group)" /></p><p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/g85kk7" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reasonable chance that you or someone you know has seen this video. It shows runners breaking off in the middle of a race to thank World War II veteran Joe Bell for his service. Bell was watching the race in uniform from the sidewalk outside his home.</p>
<p>Since the video went online Sunday, it has been picked up by dozens of media outlets — including Yahoo&#8217;s front page, Good Morning America, The Today Show and ESPN — and racked up more than one million shares online.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, the online clip had logged more than 1.2 million views. To put that in perspective, all of Digital First Media&#8217;s Tout accounts logged just over 1.8 million views in all of February. Suffice it to say, this video is a bona fide viral sensation, especially in the San Jose community.</p>
<p>The viral nature of this video is even more remarkable when you consider that the reporter who captured it, <a href="https://twitter.com/juliasulek" target="_blank">Julia Prodis Sulek</a> of the <a href="http://mercurynews.com" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, was not on assignment. She was in her house, watching the moment unfold from her window, when she realized it needed to be captured and shared.</p>
<p>She explains in an email to Inside Thunderdome:</p>
<blockquote><p>I woke up to the sounds of the runners in the morning. I looked out my window and wondered why some of them were running on the sidewalk. I looked down the street and saw Joe Bell in uniform with runners shaking his hand. I was so touched and wondered whether I should run out in my fuzzy pink bathrobe. I put clothes on instead, figuring I had missed the moment anyway, and ran outside. It was a lull at the time, but with Joe cheering people on, others cheered him back. So I started filming that. And amazingly, one runner peeled off to shake his hand, then another and another. What I loved about the tribute to Joe is that those tributes kept coming in waves throughout the race. It wasn&#8217;t like a long procession with everyone following each other. It would stop, then organically start up again. Loved it, and happy to have captured it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps what makes the video so appealing to viewers around the country is that it captures a raw moment of heart-warming honesty. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_25271319/wwii-vet-becomes-viral-video-star-san-jose-tribute" target="_blank">In this followup story</a>, Matt Bell (Joe&#8217;s son) tells Julia, &#8221;There was nothing staged about it. It was an honest response from honest people. We don&#8217;t see that too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some clips of Julia and Joe recounting the moment. These were filmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/garyjreyes" target="_blank">Gary Reyes</a>, also of the San Jose Mercury News.</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/h6ysf6" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Joe Bell explains what encouraged him to go outside and watch the race from the sidewalk. &#8220;At 95, you like to see people, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/m3bzzg" height="427" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Here is a partial list (in no particular order) of the media coverage the video has received since catching the Internet&#8217;s jet stream.</p>
<p><strong>ABC NEWS</strong>: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/03/runners-stop-mid-race-to-thank-wwii-veteran/" target="_blank">Runners stop mid-race to thank WWII veteran<br />

<p>In retrospect, this is one of those heart-warming videos that seems tailor-made for the <a href="http://upworthy.com" target="_blank">Upworthys</a> of the world. But it isn&#8217;t always easy to determine what readers will care about. Sometimes you have something that seems like a logical candidate to become a viral sensation, such as this <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/2013/11/19/the-ichicken-has-arrived/" target="_blank">&#8220;iChicken&#8221; video</a>, also from the San Jose Mercury News. But maybe the stories people want to share are happening right now outside your window. Don&#8217;t let those pass you by.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong> What lessons or conclusions can be drawn from this video&#8217;s success? What about the video captured the internet&#8217;s attention this week? Would the results have been different if covered by a smaller news outlet in a different community? Would the results have been different on a different week? Share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Davis-Shaver_avatar_1378211885-300x300-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Davis Shaver, Thunderdome technology strategist" /></p><p>Recognition for this month&#8217;s Thunderdome MVP has been a long time coming. Let&#8217;s hear it for our technology strategist, <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/dshaver" target="_blank"><strong>Davis Shaver</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Davis spent a large part of 2013 developing Thunderdome&#8217;s in-house content management system (CMS), Mission Control.</p>
<div id="attachment_6678" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Davis-Shaver_avatar_1378211885-300x300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6678" alt="Davis Shaver, Thunderdome technology strategist" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Davis-Shaver_avatar_1378211885-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">He has it under control: Davis Shaver, Thunderdome technology strategist.</p></div>
<p><strong>About Mission Control</strong><br />
Mission Control makes it possible for us to efficiently produce content and distribute to Digital First Media channels and websites. Davis also devised a way for us to automate story budgets and communication, freeing up staff hours previously spent managing Google Doc budgets and crafting advisory emails. Anyone on staff a year ago can assure you, this is a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>About Davis&#8217; nomination:</strong><br />
Thunderdome&#8217;s MVP is voted on each month by a panel of anonymous judges. Anyone can be nominated by anyone on staff. In my nomination for Davis, I wanted to remind staff how greatly his work has impacted our operation. The completion of Mission Control was a milestone for Thunderdome&#8217;s operation. The nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Guys, Davis Shaver made Mission Control. HE MADE A CMS FOR THUNDERDOME TO PUSH CONTENT TO ALL OF DFM&#8217;S ONLINE CMSs. The all-caps are necessary. And it afforded us the opportunity to ditch manually-produced Google Doc budgets and manually-penned advisories. Truly all-star work by Davis on conceiving this system and seeing it through to completion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Davis&#8217; acceptance speech</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;The real MVP here is WordPress. In addition to relying on <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">the core software</a>, we&#8217;ve tapped related open source solutions like <a href="http://editflow.org/" target="_blank">EditFlow</a> and <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> to build a powerful editorial planning and production tool for the newsroom.</p>
<p>The best part about WordPress is that you&#8217;re not alone – we&#8217;ve benefitted from thoughts and practices shared by others at the intersection of WordPress and journalism through events hosted by the <a href="http://journalists.org/" target="_blank">Online News Association</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Big-Media-WordPress-Meetup/" target="_blank">WordPress Big Media Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be posting more information about our setup in the coming months, so stay tuned.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Also nominated:</strong></p>
<p>A great deal of appreciation for video journalist <strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/dfreid" target="_blank">David Freid</a></strong> this month, who was nominated twice. <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/sglen" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;From <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/guns/" target="_blank">Firearms in the Family</a> to our <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/celebrities/ci_25104719/watch-jimmy-fallons-high-school-slow-jam-jimmy" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon parody</a>, people are not taking enough time to consider all the work he puts in. He&#8217;s a great person to work with.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The second nomination came from <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/yleow" target="_blank">Yvonne Leow</a> who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;David shot the entire video and coached our very much non-professional actors how to read the script and execute their parts. We thought we had nothing to work with, but David suggested we embrace the low production quality of the shoot and run with it. So we did. But really, he did. And we&#8217;re so glad he did. He edited all of our footage together, used his editing prowess to include a plethora of unplanned jokes and made the video what it is. Delightfully lo-fi with impeccable comedic timing. If that weren&#8217;t enough, David shared the video with his friend who knows Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s wife who said &#8220;it was too cute.&#8221; We&#8217;re 100% confident that&#8217;s why Fallon tweeted our video this morning. SUCCESS.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch" target="_blank">Chris March</a><b> </b>(me), the third nominee, was nominated by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a> who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>(Chris) has been a total MVP lately in working with the news and feature staffs on big live events like the Golden Globes, Grammys and State of the Union, including lots of late nights alongside those staffs. He&#8217;ll also soon be taking on a lot of work with the Olympics with Gary&#8217;s team.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[From covering major fires to using Tout as a video tool for storytelling, here's some breaking news advice from December's DFMie winners.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Big-Sur-fire-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Photo galleries of the Big Sur fire were a key part of Herald coverage." /></p><p>In the third of a four-part series on <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/" target="_blank">December’s DFMie winners</a>, we take a closer look at the winning breaking news entries. The DFMie winners here include the Monterey Herald for its coverage of a fire in Big Sur and the Salt Lake Tribune for its coverage of a judge&#8217;s ruling overturning the state&#8217;s ban on same-sex marriage. Alemendra Carpizo of the Chico Enterprise-Record won the Tout Bout award for her coverage of an armed robbery.</p>
<h3>Monterey Herald wins for breaking news coverage of a fire in Big Sur</h3>
<div id="attachment_6603" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/big-sur-fire/" rel="attachment wp-att-6603"><img class=" wp-image-6603 " alt="Photo galleries of the Big Sur fire were a key part of Herald coverage." src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Big-Sur-fire.jpg" width="597" height="403" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a title="Big Sur photo galleries" href="http://photos.montereyherald.com/2013/12/16/photos-firefighters-battle-wildland-fire-in-big-surs-pfeiffer-ridge-area-dec-16-2013/#1" target="_blank">Photo galleries of the Big Sur fire</a> were a key part of Herald coverage.</p></div>
<p>The Herald wins the Northern California DFMie for its staff coverage over several days of the Big Sur fire, including a <a href="http://www.montereyherald.com/localnews/ci_24733201/live-blog-fire-los-padres-national-forest-burns" target="_blank">live blog</a>, <a title="Monterey Herald photos of Big Sur fire" href="http://photos.montereyherald.com/2013/12/16/photos-firefighters-battle-wildland-fire-in-big-surs-pfeiffer-ridge-area-dec-16-2013/#1" target="_blank">photo slideshow</a> and Touts.</p>
<p><strong>Judges praised the coverage:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>They did a wonderful job of not only writing about the events, but utilizing many digital tools in the process to help tell a breaking news story.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Another judge:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Excellent coverage of a hard to cover story in difficult terrain. I got a feeling of what is was like just from the photos and story.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Inside Thunderdome asked some key contributors to the Herald&#8217;s coverage to share some lessons from their experience. Reporter Phil Molnar:</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_6604" style="width: 167px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/phil-molnar/" rel="attachment wp-att-6604"><img class=" wp-image-6604 " alt="Phil Molnar" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Phillip-Molnar-196x300.jpg" width="157" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Phil Molnar</p></div>
<blockquote><p>When covering a large fire, have a mask and a fire jacket or shirt especially to protect your health. Also, the fire jacket will allow you to take media tours with firefighters; without it, emergency personnel are less likely to allow you to ride along. And always bring a cell phone charger for your car. Touts, in particular, take a lot of juice so expect to need it. I also learned to trust the editors and website folks. I was blown away by how well they did live blogs, updates and Twitter posts.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Photojournalist David Royal:</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_6605" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/david-royal/" rel="attachment wp-att-6605"><img class=" wp-image-6605   " alt="David Royal" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/David-Royal-300x291.jpg" width="192" height="186" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Royal</p></div>
<blockquote><p>One thing I took away from covering the Big Sur fire is the importance of developing relationships with the people we were covering. The people who live full time in Big Sur are part of a small, tight-knit community that tends to be suspicious of outsiders and reporters. Developing relationships within that community, showing that we, the local paper, were there for the long haul, was a key in gaining access to areas and interviews.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Online Editor Lisa Mitchell:</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_6606" style="width: 164px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/vern-fishermonterey-county-herald/" rel="attachment wp-att-6606"><img class=" wp-image-6606  " alt="Lisa Mitchell" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Lisa-Mitchell-240x300.jpg" width="154" height="192" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lisa Mitchell</p></div>
<blockquote><p>Every member of the newsroom helped out in some way due to the extended timeline and scope of the story during our coverage of the fire, from the day it broke to following up a week later when residents could finally go home. Mobile tools and training allowed us to disseminate information quickly to the community via our live blog and dispel rumors and inaccurate reports in social media.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>City editor Dave Kellogg:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the toughest decisions is figuring out how big a story is brewing and estimating the cost of dedicating resources to it. When in doubt, bet on it being a big story. Emphasize to reporters and photographers to tweet early and often. Think through possible logistic problems (lack of a cell signal for example) and plan for them (Phil and David found a spot where there was good connectivity, a spot they returned to with regularity to file and check in.)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Salt Lake Tribune wins for coverage of judge&#8217;s ruling overturning Utah&#8217;s ban on same-sex marriage</h3>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/moZm-kse03g" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>On the Friday before Christmas, U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby ruled that Utah’s Amendment 3, defining marriage as a union exclusively between a man and a woman, violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection and due process.</p>
<p>Tribune staffers won the Metro DFMie with stellar coverage of the <a title="Salt Lake Tribune coverage of marriage ruling" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57291925-78/marriage-utah-sex-state.html.csp">ruling</a>, <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/57295302-90/vanessa-katie-marriage-clerk.html.csp">same-sex couples getting married</a>, <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57302939-78/county-licenses-marriage-sex.html.csp">county officials refusing to issue marriage licenses</a>, a <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57292943-78/marriage-utah-ruling-sex.html.csp">Q&amp;A</a>, <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsinternet/57303964-71/sex-utah-full-gallery.html.csp">photo gallery</a>, <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/57299532-82/marriage-amendment-utah-decision.html.csp">editorial saying Utah should stand with the nation and accept gay marriage</a> and a <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/57299619-90/utah-marriage-com-sex.html.csp">Trib Talk discussion of the issue</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Judges&#8217; comments about the Tribune&#8217;s coverage:</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The initial story has really become a centerpiece for the entire topic — especially with the new links that continue to be added in the related sidebar. The nearly 5,000 comments there show that this is an important story and opened a dialogue among the readers, which is really an important role for a news organization. I also loved how the journalists covered multiple angles of the day, from the text of the judge&#8217;s ruling to the personal stories and photos, while also allowing readers to share their thoughts in a public forum. The Q&amp;A was a nice, quick way to explain what had happened and what could happen next, and the Trib Talk was a perfect way to bring in the opinions of different experts (not to mention a strong use of a Google Hangout).</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Another judge:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The Salt Lake Tribune wins for AWESOME writing &#8212; and on deadline, no less.</p>
<p>&#8220;Near the end of a long line, Vanessa Vanderburg and Katie Turner wait outside the Salt Lake County clerk&#8217;s office with their arms wrapped around each other. Every time they are jostled by a camera crew, by a politician, by another couple &#8212; by the general chaos that is their wedding day &#8212; they jostle in unison.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Friday&#8217;s ruling against Utah&#8217;s gay marriage ban raises loud questions about civil rights, state&#8217;s rights and family values, Vanessa and Katie quietly embrace. They aren&#8217;t here to make a statement. They&#8217;re here to make a promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is amazing writing. The two stories in the package adroitly weave heart-tugging anecdotes with key facts, and the outstanding photos lend the final touch. The editorial is factual, clear and realistic. Bravo!</p></blockquote>
<h3>Almendra Caprizo wins Tout Bout for this armed robbery video</h3>
<p>Almendra Caprizo used Lumify to edit this video about an armed robbery, winning the ToutBout award for best video imported into the Tout app:</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/a4kq1j" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>A judge&#8217;s praise for the video:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Almendra&#8217;s narration and b-roll work very well to tell this breaking news story. Nice use of the security camera footage as b-roll. A good ender with a refer to the homepage.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_6594" style="width: 215px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Almendra-Caprizo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-6594 " alt="Almendra Caprizo" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Almendra-Caprizo.jpg" width="205" height="205" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Almendra Caprizo</p></div>
<p><strong>Caprizo&#8217;s advice:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Tout has taught me to be resourceful and to find new ways to tell a story. While Tout can be basic, if you dedicate time and effort you can develop more in-depth videos.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[We asked Mandy Jenkins some questions about her new gig as Thunderdome managing editor, her recent move to New York, and of course, karaoke. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/mandyspungeheadshot-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="mandyspungeheadshot" /></p><p>After several months of searching for the right person, it turns out that Thunderdome&#8217;s would-be managing editor was right here all along. That right person is our very own <a href="http://www.insidethunderdome.com/author/mandyjenkins" target="_blank">Mandy Jenkins</a>, who has played a crucial role building Thunderdome from the ground up.</p>
<p>Of course, Mandy is no stranger to Digital First Media newsrooms. Or to the larger digital media world, for that matter. After stints at <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/mandy-jenkins-joins-us-as-social-media-producer/" target="_blank">TBD</a> and the <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/media-lab/social-media/161798/mandy-jenkins-leaves-young-persons-job-of-social-media-editor/" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/digital-first-media-names-four-journalists-to-engagement-team/" target="_blank">she joined DFM in 2012</a>, taking on a variety of tasks that included newsroom training and development of the <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/socialwire/" target="_blank">Social Media Wire</a> tool now used widely across DFM sites. She also sits on the <a href="http://journalists.org/about/board-of-directors/" target="_blank">board of directors for the Online News Association</a> alongside fellow DFM-ers <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jbradysp" target="_blank">Jim Brady</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome/author/kbui" target="_blank">Kim Bui</a>.</p>
<p>But why does Thunderdome need a managing editor, and what will Mandy bring to the position? We asked her a few questions about the new gig, her background, her recent move to New York, and of course, karaoke. Here&#8217;s what our new managing editor has to say for herself:</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p><strong>Lives in</strong>: Long Island City, Queens<br />
<strong>Hometown</strong>: Zanesville, Ohio<br />
<strong>Graduated from</strong>: Kent State University<br />
<strong>Degree(s)</strong>: B.S. in News, M.A. in Media Management<br />
<strong>Previous work</strong>: The Huffington Post, TBD, The Cincinnati Enquirer, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and WKSU-FM.</p>
<h1>So you&#8217;re Thunderdome&#8217;s managing editor, eh?</h1>
<p><strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/03/qa-meet-thunderdomes-managing-editor-mandy-jenkins/mandyspungeheadshot/" rel="attachment wp-att-6489"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6489" alt="Photo/Alyson Aliano" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/mandyspungeheadshot-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Q: You&#8217;re Thunderdome&#8217;s very first managing editor. Tell us about this new role and what you intend to bring to it.</strong><br />
This is a role I think Thunderdome has grown to need &#8211; the newsroom is a lot bigger than it used to be and there are a lot of people and projects to track. My role is to manage the daily newsroom operations of Thunderdome, which includes supervising the news, features, sports and social media teams. I try to be a problem solver, so my first mission will be to improve our workflow to make it easier for all of the Thunderdome teams to more easily work together.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does this new role mean for other Digital First Media newsrooms? </strong><br />
As Thunderdome grows and improves, the stories and projects we create for and with our colleagues at the local level will also improve. We have a lot of interesting ideas we want to try with storytelling in the coming months and I hope I can help make that come about faster and easier. This new team alignment will also make it possible to expand our social media and community engagement efforts with local newsrooms. Stay tuned on that front.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Before this promotion, you were Thunderdome&#8217;s interactives editor. What happens to that position now that you&#8217;re vacating it? </strong><br />
In the short term, the interactives team, consisting of video, data journalism and design, will report to Robyn Tomlin directly. In the longer term, we may be doing some further reorganization as it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Showoff time: What are some of your proudest accomplishments from your time leading the interactives team? </strong><br />
This is an easy one. I am most proud of the people I hired on to this team &#8211; all of them are superheroes. Out of all the fabulous work they do, it&#8217;s tough to pick a favorite project: I love the local <a href="http://crime.denverpost.com/?source=hot-topic-bar">crime maps</a>, <a href="http://www.bracketadvisor.com/">Bracket Advisor</a>, the <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/guns/">Firearms in the Family project</a>, <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/kitchenpop/">KitchenPop</a>&#8230;it&#8217;s like asking me to choose between my cats.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share a lesson you learned while leading the interactives team.</strong><br />
Honestly? I learned in working with these guys just how much work and time goes in to making a great multimedia project. I came up through words on screens &#8211; I had no idea just what goes into making the beautiful things you can find on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You  joined Digital First Media in 2012, before there was a Thunderdome. What first drew you to DFM, and what&#8217;s kept you here all this time?</strong><br />
I have a very strong attachment to local news. I was enjoying my brief stint in national news at HuffPost,  but I felt like I could do more for the industry by helping build up local newsrooms. Also, I&#8217;ll be accused of being a suck-up, but I also really wanted a chance to work with Jim Brady again following our brief time at TBD.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You spent your first several months at DFM traveling around to local newsrooms. Do you have a favorite?</strong><br />
I really loved going to local newsrooms and spending time in those communities. It&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite place, but I do have a favorite story. When I was visiting the Vacaville newsroom in NorCal, I was held hostage in the building by an angry wild turkey. When I eventually made a break for it, he chased me to my car and aggressively pecked at my side door until I left. I&#8217;m very afraid of birds, so that was serious nightmare fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s some background that others probably don&#8217;t know about you?</strong><br />
I have held some seriously random jobs over high school and college, including: Camp cook, fast food drone, computer salesperson, wild goose wrangler (long story), pet store puppy caregiver, Hallmark associate, roofing assistant, fitness instructor, comics shop nerd whisperer&#8230;.it goes on.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You&#8217;ve taught journalism and led training for people all around the globe. What makes for a good teacher?</strong><br />
Understanding the roadblocks facing students and addressing them head-on is key to a successful workshop or class. I get that newsrooms are short-staffed and everyone&#8217;s just trying to keep heads above water on a day-to-day basis &#8211; so I always try to suggest how new tasks I&#8217;m suggesting fit into a very busy workload.</p>
<h1>Now for some real talk.</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why journalism?</strong><br />
I like disappointing my parents. Seriously, though, I wasn&#8217;t 100% sold on journalism until I worked at my college newspaper, The Daily Kent Stater, my freshman year. I was immediately hooked on the newsroom culture, getting information before everyone else, getting hate mail &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t imagine doing anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you subscribe to any print publications? If not, why?</strong><br />
We subscribe to a few magazines: <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, <em>ESPN</em>, <em>Food Network</em>&#8230;I&#8217;m still very attached to magazines as a print experience for some reason. We just recently moved, but in D.C. we did get the Sunday <em>Washington Post</em>. I rarely read the print edition, but my husband (who is a reporter) insisted on it. We might get a weekend paper here in New York, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What would happen if you were disconnected from the internet and your phone for 48 hours?</strong><br />
Everyone I know would think I was dead due to my social silence &#8211; and I might be because I rely on my phone&#8217;s mapping way too much. I could end up falling in the East River.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What was the first thing you read this morning?</strong><br />
Probably my notifications on my phone, usually in this order: Texts, tweet replies, Facebook comments, then emails.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is your all-time favorite sports team?</strong><br />
The Cincinnati Reds are my favorite team in any sport. When spring training rolls around, I&#8217;m going to be insufferable.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you could interview any historical figure, who would it be?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not an especially religious person, but probably Judas Iscariot. I&#8217;d like to know more about his side of the story &#8211; it&#8217;d be a compelling narrative, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s for lunch today?</strong><br />
A homemade <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/explore/mason-jar-salads/" target="_blank">stacked salad in a jar</a>. I&#8217;m sort of obsessed with the concept right now.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your go-to karaoke song? </strong><br />
Carly Simon&#8217;s &#8220;You&#8217;re So Vain&#8221; &#8211; everyone thinks it is about them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you listen to music these days? </strong><br />
Either on Rdio&#8217;s iPhone app or via the All Songs Considered podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You just moved to New York City from D.C. Which one wins your heart? </strong><br />
I&#8217;m very new to New York, so D.C. is still my favorite &#8211; but check back in a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <a href="http://www.raysplacekent.com/">Ray&#8217;s</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Loft-Kent/123798544359286">Loft</a>? Taylor or Franklin? </strong> <em>(Submitted by @twoTstwoFs)</em><br />
Those ones are easy for a Kent Stater of my generation: Ray&#8217;s and Taylor (of course). Ray&#8217;s is a Kent bar scene institution, Taylor Hall housed the journalism school when I was a student, now it is in Franklin Hall.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s your all-time favorite meme?</strong><br />
The <a title="Facebook reach down? Here’s a guide for what works, what doesn’t." href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/01/22/facebook-reach-journalists-guide/" target="_blank">Oprah Bees gif</a>. I still laugh hysterically every single time I see it. I will never stop loving it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What movie or book has had the greatest impact on you?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s probably no film I quote more in my day-to-day work life than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110771/">&#8220;The Paper&#8221;</a>. Sadly, nobody else gets it. I need to make Thunderdomers watch that movie sometime.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Name someone we should all follow on Twitter right now.</strong><br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/DFMThunderdome" target="_blank">@DFMThunderdome</a>, of course.</p>

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)" /></p><p>Just as with Google, everything that shows in a user&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed" target="_blank">Facebook News Feed is dictated by a complex algorithm</a> that is constantly evolving. If you manage a Facebook page for your news brand, you almost certainly noticed a dramatic decline in organic page reach over the past month due to some recent tweaks to this algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>So what happened? Why is reach down?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=781079165252672&amp;set=a.123367607690501.18902.119553158071946&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a sound explanation from Ivan Lajara, life editor of the Daily Freeman.</a></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s an <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/768/News-Feed-FYI-Helping-You-Find-More-News-to-Talk-About" target="_blank">explainer from Facebook about why these changes are important</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What can we can do?</strong><br />
Ivan took this conversation to <a href="http://dailyfreeman.blogspot.com/2014/01/dfm-chat-on-facebook-page-engagement.html" target="_blank">a recent installment of #DFMChat</a>, which he hosts every Wed. at 12 p.m. ET. His intent was to capture best practices and resources that can help journalists re-think their approach to Facebook pages. So, he presented the group with <a href="https://hackpad.com/Facebook-for-newsrooms-Xep6ARhmgAz">this collaborative Hackpad document</a> designed to capture and flesh out the best points and links tweeted during the #DFMChat (and after).</p>
<h1><strong>Here it is: <a href="https://hackpad.com/Facebook-for-newsrooms-Xep6ARhmgAz" target="_blank">The Facebook for newsrooms guide<br />
</a></strong></h1>
<p>Anything to add? The Hackpad is open for collaboration, so edit in your own findings and suggested resources.</p>
<p>In something of a twist, <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/787/News-Feed-FYI-What-Happens-When-You-See-More-Updates-from-Friends" target="_blank">Facebook announced another change to the algorithm yesterday</a>, which has implications for some of the best practices laid out on the guide just a week ago. According to Chris Turitzin, FB&#8217;s News Feed product manager, posts with links and previews will now rank better for pages, while text-only posts will rank better for individual users. So it&#8217;s important that journalists managing pages keep an eye on their reach and insights and continue to experiment with what works and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Ivan, and hopefully others, will keep the Facebook for newsrooms guide up-to-date well into the foreseeable future.
