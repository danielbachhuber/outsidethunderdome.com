				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/ba_header-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="After you get the predicted probability of outcome between any two teams, click &#039;share this matchup&#039; to spread the word on Twitter." /></p><p>Whether you are a college basketball expert or novice, our <a href="http://www.bracketadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Bracket Advisor</a> tool can help you make educated selections in your March Madness pool.</p>
<p>Thunderdome&#8217;s NCAA Tournament tool is up and running, giving you the probability of outcome for any possible tournament matchup. Bracket Advisor&#8217;s projections are based on a statistical comparison of teams in the 2014 tournament field to teams from the last 11 NCAA tournaments.</p>
<div id="attachment_7599" style="width: 593px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="bracketadvisor.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-7599" alt="ba_header2" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/ba_header2.jpg" width="583" height="286" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After comparing any two teams, you can click &#8216;share this matchup&#8217; to spead the word on Twitter.</p></div>
<p>Bracket Advisor is the linchpin of Thunderdome&#8217;s 2014 NCAA Tournament coverage. Each of Digital First Media&#8217;s 70+ core sites has a subchannel dedicated to tournament coverage, located at dfm.(propertyname).com/college-basketball, such as <a href="http://dfm.denverpost.com/college-basketball" target="_blank">dfm.denverpost.com/college-basketball</a>.</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s new this year?</h1>
<p>Bracket Advisor was one of Thunderdome&#8217;s most popular features in 2013, and this year we&#8217;ve added a new wrinkle by connecting the tool directly to a functioning bracket. Users who make their picks on our <a href="http://www.bracketadvisor.com/interactive-bracket/" target="_blank">interactive online bracket</a> can get help from Bracket Advisor right on that page by clicking the &#8220;Consult BA&#8221; text.</p>
<p>Casual college basketball fans can use that prediction to help them make selections right up to the championship game. Hardcore fans may want to dive a little deeper into Bracket Advisor and customize the categories (seed, RPI, conference, scoring margin and more) and the rank order of those categories to come up with an even more insightful selection. Once your bracket is complete, print it out and submit it to your pool!</p>
<p>Want personalized help from Bracket Advisor? He (or she, we&#8217;re not saying) is available on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/bracketadvisor" target="_blank">@BracketAdvisor</a>, to respond directly to your pleas for help.</p>
<p>Good luck to your favorite teams in the tournament — and to you in your pool!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This month's cross-team collaboration award goes to the makeshift team who produced Digital First Media's Olympics channel. Here is a look at how they did it from sports editor Gary Kicinski.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Cover-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Fireworks explode during the Closing Ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Olympics outside of the Bolshoy Ice Dome Sunday February 23, 2014. (Photo by Chris Detrick/The Salt Lake Tribune)" /></p><p>The Olympic sport of biathlon combines the skills of cross-country skiing with rifle shooting.</p>
<p>Thus, relatively speaking, it didn&#8217;t seem quite so bizarre when we decided to combine a features producer, a community engagement manager, our world news channel manager and four sports staffers into a 24/7 desk to produce <a href="http://dfm.denverpost.com/olympics" target="_blank">Olympics content</a> for <a title="Expansive Winter Olympics coverage for Digital First Media websites" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/05/expansive-winter-olympics-coverage-digital-media-websites/" target="_blank">11 channels</a> to 70-plus DFM sites over 17 days.</p>
<p><a href="dfm.lowellsun.com/olympics"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6941" alt="olyfront" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/olyfront.jpg" width="662" height="560" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The winner</strong><br />
That eclectic group is February&#8217;s winner of Thunderdome&#8217;s cross-team collaboration award. (<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2014/02/04/kitchen-pop-team-secures-win/" target="_blank">Last month&#8217;s award went to &#8220;Kitchen Pop.</a>&#8220;)</p>
<p>In his nomination, sports producer <a href="http://insidethundedome.com/author/mwalks" target="_blank">Matt Walks</a> noted that the team produced about 500 pieces of content during the games and maintained an always-active liveblog. The team worked directly with reporters in Russia, which Matt said &#8220;helped increase awareness and understanding of Thunderdome throughout our realm.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_6942" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://dfm.mercurynews.com/olympics"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6942" alt="ssjm0209olympics053" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/ssjm0209olympics053-203x300.jpg" width="203" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Russia&#8217;s Yulia Lipnitskaya performs for the Team Ladies Short Program at the Iceberg Skating Palace in Sochi, Russia on Saturday, Feb. 8, 2014. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group)</p></div>
<p>Sports borrowed <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/kmetz" target="_blank">Kelly Metz</a> from Features and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch" target="_blank">Chris March</a> from our engagement desk to steer the liveblog on weekdays, and they kept readers abreast of the action in Sochi during the busiest part of the day, which coincided with our peak traffic period. The <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a> blog racked up 1.6 million engagement minutes during the Olympics.</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/chopkins" target="_blank">Chris Hopkins</a> brought his experienced editing eye from the news desk over to sports, where he teamed with Matt Walks, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jbinckes" target="_blank">Jeremy Binckes</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/rmaghielse" target="_blank">Ross Maghielse</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jneukamm" target="_blank">Johannes Neukamm</a> to showcase the work of reporters and photographers from the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com" target="_blank">Denver Post</a>, the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, the <a href="http://sltrib.com" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tribune</a> and the <a href="http://www.twincities.com" target="_blank">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>.</p>

<li>The team that worked on <strong><a href="http://www.twincities.com/ci_25046767/philip-seymour-hoffman-found-dead-new-york-city" target="_blank">Philip Seymour Hoffman’s death</a></strong>. Nominator Dan Lewis said &#8220;<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jhendrickson/" target="_blank">John Hendrickson</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwagner/" target="_blank">Meg Wagner</a>, Jillian Sederholm and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jwestfall/" target="_blank">Julie Westfall</a> did a great job on covering (it) … John went out and was the man on Tout coverage, while the news team was on top of Spundge updates.&#8221;</li>

<li><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/bprieto" target="_blank">Bianca Prieto</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jfields" target="_blank">Jason Fields</a>, David Freid, Nelson Hsu, Courtney Wells and Yvonne Leow for the <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/guns/" target="_blank">Firearms in the Family package</a>, nominated by Yvonne Leow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip of the week<br />
</strong>When planning coverage for a big event such as the Olympics that requires coordination of efforts from multiple properties, Too Much Information is a good thing. In short, <em>overshare</em>.</p>
<p>In preparing for the Olympics, we organized weekly phone calls with top editors to keep them abreast of development plans and to seek their input on coverage approaches. These phone calls were followed up by e-mail recaps, and those recaps were stored in a Google doc accessible to all. Why the redundancies?</p>
<ul>
<li>Carpet-bombing technique catches editors who couldn&#8217;t make a call or may have been distracted during a call.</li>
<li>Digital record helps clarify any confusing points, establishes a record of conversation and followup plans.</li>
<li>Reinforcement makes it easier to recall key coverage points and keep everybody on track, resulting in less time being devoted to retracing old ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cue the Olympics theme song.</p>
<p>With the flick of a switch on Jan. 29 (in reality it&#8217;s more complicated than that), Digital First Media rolled out 10 Olympics &#8220;subchannels&#8221; across 70+ Websites, providing readers of DFM properties with comprehensive coverage as we draw nearer to the start of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, Feb. 7.</p>
<p>That sweeping move has more than tripled the number of Thunderdome-powered channels from 4 to 14. Previously we launched channels for <a href="http://dfm.mercurynews.com/health" target="_blank">Health</a>, <a href="http://dfm.ydr.com/nation" target="_blank">Nation</a>, <a href="http://dfm.insidebayarea.com/world" target="_blank">World </a>and the <a href="http://dfm.theoaklandpress.com/olympics" target="_blank">main Olympics channel</a>.</p>
<p>This puts us in position to easily deliver 24/7 Olympics coverage to DFM local audiences, produced once from Thunderdome with no local intervention necessary.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6554 alignright" alt="promo" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/promo.jpg" width="98" height="101" /><strong>Where to find the Olympics channel on DFM sites</strong><br />
A one-column promo on Homefronts and Sports fronts directs users to the main Olympics channel and other features (<a href="http://mercurynews.sportsdirectinc.com/olympics/schedule.aspx" target="_blank">schedule</a>, <a href="http://sltrib.sportsdirectinc.com/olympics/results.aspx" target="_blank">results</a>, <a href="http://twincities.sportsdirectinc.com/olympics/medals.aspx" target="_blank">medals</a> and <a href="http://photos.denverpost.com/category/winter-olympics-2014/" target="_blank">photo gallery</a>). The subchannels are accessed through a dropdown menu on the main Olympics channel.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Digital First Media journalists covering Sochi</strong><br />
A team of 11 veteran reporters, columnists and photographers from the Denver Post, Salt Lake Tribune, San Jose Mercury News and St. Paul Pioneer Press in Sochi will be providing company-wide daily news coverage and features. <a href="https://twitter.com/DFMlive/dfm-olympics-2014/members" target="_blank">Most of them will be tweeting coverage as it happens</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/spmediaday_2jl7530x-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) answers questions during the team&#039;s Media Day Tuesday at the Prudential Center. (Photo by John Leyba/The Denver Post)" /></p><p>The DFM Super Bowl between the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers didn&#8217;t materialize (maybe next year, San Jose Mercury), but the Broncos still made it to New York, and DFM resources are being mobilized en masse to bring comprehensive coverage of Super Bowl XLVIII to the DFM audience.</p>
<p>The Denver Post has set up shop in the Big Apple to lead the way for DFM, launching a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/superbowl" target="_blank">Super Bowl XLVIII index page</a> that spotlights twice-daily live streaming programs, blogs, photos, video and more.</p>
<p>Denver&#8217;s massive effort is aided by staffers from Thunderdome, the <a href="http://nhregister.com" target="_blank">New Haven Register</a> and <a href="http://delcotimes.com" target="_blank">Delaware County Times</a>, and supplemented by coverage from properties such as the <a href="http://trentonian.com" target="_blank">Trentonian</a>, the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, the <a href="http://dailynews.com" target="_blank">Los Angeles Daily News</a> and the <a href="http://sltrib.com" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p>
<p>Thunderdome is assembling the best of that content and packaging it up Digital First Media properties in three primary fashions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_24988477/super-bowl-2014-seattle-seahawks-vs-denver-broncos" target="_blank">Rebel Mouse page</a>, which serves as an index to the best features and most important news stories.</li>
<li>A Super Bowl display group, offered to properties for placement on their sites, containing a steady stream of news, with the Rebel Mouse index page pinned to the top of the container.</li>
<li>A takeover of the middle section of The Bottom Line for the week, spotlighting more buzz-worthy or interesting off-the-field Super Bowl-related content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the content highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live programming</strong>: Daily streaming video shows produced by The Post from 9-11 a.m. ET and 5-7 p.m. ET, running through Friday.</li>
<li><strong>Photos and video</strong>: Produced by Photodome. Check your local <a href="http://photos.denverpost.com/category/sports/broncos/super-bowl/" target="_blank">Media Center</a>.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/NEW_paula_pasche-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Paula Pasche" /></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Readers of Michigan&#8217;s Digital First Media newspapers have known for years that they could count on reporter Paula Pasche for in-depth and timely coverage of the Detroit Lions.</span></p>
<p>In addition to her reporting, <a href="http://oplions.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blogging</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/paulapasche" target="_blank">tweeting</a> for news outlets including <a href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/" target="_blank">The Oakland Press</a>, Pasche has authored a book on the Lions, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Lions-Fans-Should-Before/dp/1600787290/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389067465&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=100+things+lions+fans+should+know+%26+do+before+they+die" target="_blank">100 Things Lions Fans Should Know &amp; Do Before They Die</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now readers across <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-serve/" target="_blank">the entire Digital First Media landscape</a> know her for her NFL prediction powers as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_6268" style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-6268" alt="Paula Pasche" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/01/paula_pasche.jpg" width="160" height="199" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paula Pasche</p></div>
<p>Pasche and five other writers <a title="DFM writers tackle football season with interactive features and insight" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/09/13/dfm-football-2013-features/" target="_blank">put their reputations on the line each week this season</a>, predicting the outcomes of each NFL game in our <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/national-sports-news/ci_24796405/week-17-nfl-picks-can-you-outdo-our" target="_blank">NFL Experts&#8217; Picks feature</a>. Pasche surged to the front early in the 17-week season, going 12-4 in Week One, and was never overtaken in her wire-to-wire victory.</p>
<p>Pasche finished with a record of 172-83 (.675), beating out <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeOGorman" target="_blank">George O&#8217;Gorman of the Trentonian</a> (170-85, .667) by two correct picks.</p>
<p>For comparison, Pasche would have beaten 12 of the 13 experts on <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/picks/_/week/17/seasontype/2" target="_blank">ESPN&#8217;s panel</a>, with only Ron Jaworski (174-81, .682) managing a record better than Pasche. She also would have beaten all eight of the human experts at <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/features/writers/expert/picks/straight-up/17" target="_blank">CBSSports.com</a>, and tied for first among the eight experts at <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/01/03/staff-picks-wild-card-playoffs-2013-awards/4305917/" target="_blank">USATODAY.com</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My &#8216;secret formula&#8217; involved looking at the spread, the home team, and then going mostly with my gut. And, of course, a lot of luck,&#8221; Pasche said.</p>
<p>All six of the DFM writers also contributed a &#8220;Lock of the Week&#8221; in Tout video form, with Pasche relying on her <a href="http://www.tout.com/m/gf1m2i" target="_blank">magic apple tree</a> as inspiration for many of her sure-fire bets.</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/gf1m2i" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Our other four prognosticators were <a href="https://twitter.com/MercPurdy" target="_blank">Mark Purdy</a> of the San Jose Mercury News, <a href="https://twitter.com/BobGrotz" target="_blank">Bob Grotz</a> of the Delaware County Daily Times, <a href="https://twitter.com/jsbrownsinsider" target="_blank">Jeff Schudel</a> of the northern Ohio News-Herald and <a href="https://twitter.com/merganser10" target="_blank">Dave Pevear</a> of the Lowell Sun.</p>
<p>The predictions app was designed by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu" target="_blank">Nelson Hsu</a>, built by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/vhagerty/" target="_blank">Vaughn Hagerty</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/sglen/" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a>, and managed by <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/mwalks/" target="_blank">Matt Walks</a> at Thunderdome.</p>
<p>With the regular season having concluded, our experts have kindly agreed to continue making their picks through the postseason, so watch for their playoff and Super Bowl predictions on a DFM site near you.</p>

(AP Photo/Don Wright)" /></p><p>The Boys of Summer begin their march to the Fall Classic on the same day the fastest winter sport on ice begins its regular season.</p>
<p>Feeling seasonally challenged by that? Thunderdome is here to help.</p>
<p>The Major League Baseball postseason, and the National Hockey League regular season begin Oct. 1, and Thunderdome will be curating the most important and most interesting elements of both for the readers of <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-serve/" target="_blank">Digital First Media newsrooms</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4518" alt="mlb" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/mlb-300x132.jpg" width="300" height="132" /><strong>2013 MLB postseason coverage plans</strong></p>
<p>MLB&#8217;s playoffs open with a wild-card game on Oct. 1 and progress through the League Championship Series and World Series. Each weekday morning, Thunderdome will offer a postseason version of its <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_24205072" target="_blank">MLB Replay feature,</a> capturing not only the news of the day but the buzz as well, with photos, GIFs, tweets, video and more. It will also look forward to upcoming games. It&#8217;s one-stop shopping for your time-pressed readers who just want someone to hit the highlights for them.</p>
<p>As we approach the LCS and World Series, we will be rounding up writers from around Digital First Media properties for live chats. And for the most compelling games, we will be using <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a> to bring you action, reaction and insights as the events unfold. Such coverage will  be available for syndication to non-DFM media outlets as well, via the <a href="https://market.scribblelive.com/Events/Client/4809" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>We will distribute features and columns from our DFM properties who have a team in the hunt, including <a href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/" target="_blank">The Oakland Press</a> (Detroit Tigers), <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Daily News</a> (L.A. Dodgers), <a href="http://info.bayareanewsgroup.com/" target="_blank">Bay Area News Group</a> (Oakland A&#8217;s) and the <a href="http://www.news-herald.com/" target="_blank">News-Herald</a>/<a href="http://www.morningjournal.com/" target="_blank">Morning Journal</a> (Cleveland Indians).</p>
<p><strong>NHL regular season plans</strong></p>
<p>You may recall that late last year we tried a similar daily approach with hockey coverage, branded <a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/golf/ci_23297016/san-jose-sharks-win-kings-bruins-rangers-lundqvist" target="_blank">NHL Replay</a>. However, we saw a pretty low adoption rate for that offering, as well as a low adoption rate for our <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_22771156/nhl-live-chat" target="_blank">weekly NHL chat</a>. So this year, we will try a different approach.</p>
<p><a href="http://nhl.com"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/1/491/thumbs/wkue6hfkzqs2bnl0efw8sihf7.gif" width="150" height="100" /></a>Each weekday morning we will sift through the news of the previous night, looking for the fantastic plays, the quirky tidbits and the major news from the NHL that should appeal to sports fans in general. So we&#8217;ll move away from a hardcore insider approach to a broader tactic, and publish individual items that merit posting. Hopefully these are the ones that sports fans will be talking about, and hopefully this will work in your community whether you are identified as a hockey hotbed or not. And of course throughout the season we will be on the lookout to distribute the best hockey features produced by the DFM properties that do cover an NHL team.</p>

<p><strong>NFL Expert Picks</strong><br />
<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/picksgrid.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4407" alt="picksgrid" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/picksgrid.jpg" width="338" height="362" /></a>Writers from six DFM properties are putting their reputations on the line by making weekly NFL picks. Users can scan the selections, see who’s favored and vote on who will win each game, or just use the expert advice as guidance for making their own picks. The writers also provide a “Lock of the Week” – their bet-the-mortgage-on-this-one pick – in Tout form, and some of them have found creative ways to make their selections. Check out the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_24014711/nfl-experts-picks" target="_blank">latest round of picks for week two</a>.</p>
<p>The tool was built and designed at Thunderdome by the team of <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/vhagerty/" target="_blank">Vaughn Hagerty</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/nhsu/" target="_blank">Nelson Hsu</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/sglen/" target="_blank">Sarah Glen</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/tmeagher/" target="_blank">Tom Meagher</a>. Writers who are participating are <a href="https://twitter.com/BobGrotz" target="_blank">Bob Grotz</a>, who covers the Philadelphia Eagles for the Delaware County Daily Times; <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeOGorman" target="_blank">George O’Gorman</a>, who covers the New York Giants for The Trentonian; <a href="https://twitter.com/paulapasche" target="_blank">Paula Pasche</a>, who covers the Detroit Lions for The Oakland Press; <a href="https://twitter.com/merganser10" target="_blank">Dave Pevear</a>, who covers the New England Patriots for the Lowell Sun; <a href="https://twitter.com/MercPurdy" target="_blank">Mark Purdy</a>, a 49ers/Raiders columnist for the San Jose Mercury News; and <a href="https://twitter.com/jsbrownsinsider" target="_blank">Jeff Schudel</a>, who covers the Cleveland Browns for The News-Herald of northern Ohio.</p>
<p>New picks for the upcoming weekend are released every Wednesday evening.</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy football live chat and column</strong><br />
Millions of Americans play fantasy football each week, and the hunger for information and advice is insatiable. So three of our own DFM fantasy fanatics are offering weekly content to address those pangs.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ellisdrew" target="_blank">Drew Ellis</a> of the Oakland Press, <a href="https://twitter.com/skeeoos" target="_blank">Don Gardner</a> of the Macomb Daily and <a href="https://twitter.com/NHRDanNowak" target="_blank">Dan Nowak</a> of the New Haven Register team up to offer weekly advice in a live chat on Wednesdays at noon ET. They share the latest news on injuries and player transactions and take reader questions about which players should be in their starting lineup that week. The chat transcript also has shelf life up until Sunday’s kickoff. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/digital-first-media/ci_24064792/fantasy-football-2013-week-2-advice" target="_blank">Check out the replay of this week&#8217;s chat</a>.</p>
<p>These chats are produced through <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a> and are available for free to all ScribbleLive clients via the <a href="https://market.scribblelive.com/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>. If you have any questions about how to syndicate this chat on your site for your readers, please email live channel manager <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch/" target="_blank">Chris March</a> at <a href="mailto: cmarch@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">cmarch@digitalfirstmedia.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy football columns from Dan Nowak<br />
</strong><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dan_nowak.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4409 alignright" alt="dan_nowak" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/09/dan_nowak.jpg" width="171" height="195" /></a>In addition, Nowak writes a weekly column that is released on Friday evenings, focusing on something topical in the fantasy world and offering <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_24033776" target="_blank">his latest recommendations</a> on “Start ‘em” and “Sit ‘em” players. Check out Nowak&#8217;s column from week 1.</p>
<p>Dan doesn’t stop there – for those in the audience who aren’t into fantasy but have, shall we say, a vested interest in the outcome of NFL games, Dan offers a weekly “<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_24035164" target="_blank">Betting the NFL</a>” column that is available every Friday evening. In this column Dan makes his picks “against the spread.” Check out last week&#8217;s column.</p>
<p><strong>Coming soon: Heisman candidates</strong><br />
Trentonian editor <a href="https://twitter.com/trentonianozzy" target="_blank">Matthew Osborne</a>, a Heisman Trophy voter, offered a preseason look at this year’s Heisman candidates, and will be offering a weekly ranking of his top five contenders beginning in late September. This feature will be available each Sunday night.</p>
<p><strong>NFL Replays, gamers and more to come<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Throughout each week, we will share the best football features and breaking news from our properties covering the biggest teams and top players and programs in pro and college football. </span>We’ll be producing football content from Thunderdome as well, with features such as <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_24088195" target="_blank">NFL Replay</a> and interesting things curated from the Web.</p>
<p>It culminates in January with a national championship game at the Rose Bowl in warm-weather Pasadena, and a February Super Bowl in balmy (?) New Jersey.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll go along for the ride.</p>
<p><em>If you have any questions or suggestions about these features, please contact sports channel manager Gary Kicinski at <a href="mailto: gkicinksi@digitalfirstmedia.com" target="_blank">gkicinski@digitalfirstmedia.com</a> or leave a comment.<br />
