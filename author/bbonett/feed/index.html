His talk was about using Twitter for sports journalism. (Hank Winnicki)" /></p><p>On Monday, May 6, Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., hosted an APSE Northeast Regional Meeting attended by sports editors, sports writers, administrators and dozens of Marist students. Among the event’s presenters was Bobby Bonett, Thunderdome’s Deputy Sports Channel Manager, who co-hosted a discussion on Twitter for sports journalists.</p>
<p>Bonett teamed with Newsday Sports Multimedia Editor Mark La Monica to facilitate a discussion of the do’s and don’ts of reporting sports on Twitter. Bonett, La Monica and the audience aimed to answer how breaking news should be reported, the best way to gain Twitter followers, tips on searching Twitter for sources and breaking news reaction, and a brief discussion on leveraging online stories for a social audience.</p>
<p>Twitter has become a paramount tool in the reporting of breaking news, with many sports fans turning first to the microblogging site before researching the news on their favorite sports website. Reporters, therefore, find themselves on the clock all day, even during the offseason, in order to be on top of breaking or developing news. Speaking from the perspective of a reader rather than a reporter, some of the students in the audience were able to address what they liked (interaction with followers, for example) and didn’t like about the sports writers they followed.</p>
<p>Reporters for several newspapers across the Digital First Media chain have seen success in using Twitter to promote live events. A recent live <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_23053797/digital-first-medias-2013-nfl-mock-draft">NFL mock draft</a>, for example, finished with more than 15,000 page views, according to website analytics, and 238,437 engagement minutes, according to ScribbleLive, the chat platform on which the event was held. Almost all of this traffic was driven by the social media accounts of the 13 sports reporters who participated in the event.</p>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways from the presentation was the importance of self-promotion – in moderation – when on Twitter. The speakers stressed that there are few better ways to drive traffic to a live chat, for example, than letting your followers know ahead of time. And while a timeline flooded with self-promotion can deter potential followers, doing so at strategic times – for example, once the day before the chat, once the morning of the chat, and once as the chat begins – can drive the target audience to participate.</p>
<p>The program included several other fascinating panels, including a look at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/">award-winning multimedia projects</a>, a debate on the ethics of sports writers voting for the Baseball Hall of Fame, and a discussion centered on young writers finding their voice.</p>
<p>The conference was held at the Hancock Center and organized by Keith Strudler, the Director of the Marist College Center for Sports Communication. Hank Winnicki, Newsday’s sports editor and the chair of the APSE Northeast Region, organized the program. Among the speakers were longtime BBWAA member Phil Pepe, Baseball Hall of Fame president Jeff Idelson, ESPN investigative reporter T.J. Quinn, and Selena Roberts, the founder of <a href="http://www.roopstigo.com/">roopstigo.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2012/11/la-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="DS22-LAKERS-KINGS-DC" /></p><p>It&#8217;s 8:00 a.m. in Oakland, Calif., and you just dragged yourself into the office. You overhear your co-workers talking about last night’s basketball game. Or that ridiculous touchdown reception by some wide receiver you’ve never heard of. Or the trade rumors that have your favorite player heading to the (gulp) San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p>Sure, you’d jump into the conversation. But unfortunately, you were busy watching CM Punk submit John Cena to retain the WWE Championship last night. And while you always wear <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/go/+/">your “GTS” t-shirt</a> underneath your chic Express button-down, your manager thinks that wrestling “is for kids,” taking that talking point out of the equation. (Shows what he knows.)</p>
<p>Frantically, you look for a way to get a full recap of the previous night’s sports happenings in one shot. Sure, you’d turn to Twitter, but you&#8217;re following 14,000 people at this point, and the last 42 tweets all link to the same <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/21-lessons-learned-from-mario-kart-64">BuzzFeed article on MarioKart 64</a> – which naturally, you&#8217;ve already spent the last five minutes reading. Oops.</p>
<p>If only there was a one-stop shop to get an overnight sports digest . . .</p>
<p>That’s where Digital First Media’s sports team comes in. Each morning, as we await the launch of our national sports channel, the sports team is producing a feature nicknamed “<a href="http://www.troyrecord.com/articles/2012/11/19/sports/doc50aa50bbb0571250729640.txt">While you were sleeping</a>.” It is a comprehensive recap of everything sports-related that probably happened after you hit the hay: a late-night college football game, a developing MLB free agency rumor, or a ridiculous Andrew Bynum GIF, for example.</p>
<p>While providing a service to readers, the morning roundup also allows local DFM sports producers and editors to look ahead at the day’s upcoming events, rather than playing catch-up. Instead of spending the morning scouring wires for non-local sports content, newsrooms are delivered a neatly-packaged piece that handles a morning’s worth of work in one story.</p>
<p>The roundup is typically released around 10 a.m. EST, just in time for the daily water cooler talk. It can be found on a number of Digital First Media’s sites – the <a href="http://www.troyrecord.com/articles/2012/11/19/sports/doc50aa50bbb0571250729640.txt">Troy Record</a> or the <a href="http://www.marinij.com/sports/ci_22009131/knicks-beat-spurs-only-undefeated-nba-team">Marin Independent Journal</a>, for example – or at <a href="http://storify.com/DigitalFirst">DFM’s Storify page</a>.</p>
