<p><em>Editor’s note: This is the tenth in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I attended the <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/bring-your-social-game-to-the-pro-level/#.UoQpt5RgYRw" target="_blank">Pro-level Social session at ONA13</a>. Tons of great tips came out of this session, but one thing really stuck out for me. After being inundated with questions about Facebook&#8217;s algorithm, <a href="https://twitter.com/petersmeg" target="_blank">Meghan Peters</a>, who works in Strategic Partnerships for Facebook, said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s based off of connections. Our goal is to serve up the most relevant post to that individual user. It&#8217;s based on the user&#8217;s interactions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, it&#8217;s personalized, based on the interests and friends and &#8220;likes&#8221; for an individual user, to an extent. This stuck with me.</p>
<p>Language, voice and word choices probably matter. How people use Facebook in their day-to-day lives probably matters.</p>
<p>After I returned to the <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/" target="_blank">Morning Sun</a> from ONA, I decided to experiment with the voice and content of our daily <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MPmorningsun" target="_blank">Facebook</a> weather post, to see what factors affect how posts display in news feeds.</p>
<p>Our daily weather post has increased reach by 5-7 times or more since I&#8217;ve made these changes. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/274400362581037" target="_blank">Facebook defines &#8220;reach&#8221; as,</a> &#8220;The number of unique people who received impressions of a Page post. The reach number might be less than the impressions number since one person can see multiple impressions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BEFORE:</strong><br />
<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/old-weather.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4973" alt="old weather" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/old-weather.jpg" width="420" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AFTER:</strong><br />
<a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-shot-2013-11-11-at-2.19.29-PM.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4974" alt="Screen shot 2013-11-11 at 2.19.29 PM" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-shot-2013-11-11-at-2.19.29-PM.jpg" width="438" height="383" /></a></p>
<p>Here is breakdown of the changes that helped increase the reach:</p>
<p><strong>Think SEO, but with more lifestyles relevance:</strong> I started by making changes to the language. Previous weather reports were more like bulletins. I wanted to add more immediacy, so I used words like &#8220;today,&#8221; &#8220;weather,&#8221; &#8220;mid-Michigan,&#8221; &#8220;central Michigan.&#8221; It appears that posts with timeliness, location and lifestyle information helped improve our reach.</p>
<p><strong>Be conversational</strong>: Our previous weather posts featured some all-caps writing, and a lot of ellipses and/or fragmented sentences. So, I changed the tone to a more conversational one. In scrolling through our newsfeed, I actually noticed that any post with all caps or sentence fragments had significantly less reach. I eliminated the impersonal tone, and watched the reach of our weather posts increase.</p>
<p><strong>Use active verb tense</strong>: Just like stories and photo captions, an active, present tense voice is more engaging and appears to improve reach.</p>
<p><strong>Time of day is important:</strong> I began posting our weather status between 5:30 and 6 a.m., which is a little earlier than before. Half of the reach numbers on these statuses were attained by 7 a.m., and the other half came throughout the day. Considering when the information is most relevant to the community may get more views in news feeds.</p>
<p><strong>Does the poster matter?</strong> We have several admins for our Facebook page. Do posts made by more Facebook-engaged users get more reach? Maybe. I am pretty engaged, and my posts on our branded page nearly always have higher numbers than other admins who aren&#8217;t as engaged overall. With our weather, when I took over posting the weather after ONA, our numbers went up. It&#8217;s something to consider, and something I am watching.</p>
<p>The reach numbers, and the differences between the two styles, are about average for us. So changing our style increased our engagement tremendously.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br />
What do you think of these suggestions? Have you noticed any factors on your own Facebook page that can improve reach and engagement?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/articlemachine-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Some questions to tackle in breaking the article machine. (Credit: Karen Workman, via Twitter @KarenWorkman)" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the sixth in a series of reports from five Digital First Media journalists who attended ONA13 through the <a title="Digital First’s ONA contest: And the winners are…" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/07/23/digital-first-represents-ona-contest-winners/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program.</em></p>
<p>I came back to the <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/" target="_blank">Morning Sun</a> from <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/" target="_blank">ONA13</a> stirring with ideas for how to better engage our readers and to improve our storytelling. Here are the top five:</p>
<p><strong>1. Launch a community photo club. </strong><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/what-is-photojournalism-worth/#.UnqV8JRga0Q" target="_blank">One of my favorite sessions</a> focused on National Geographic&#8217;s <a href="http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/" target="_blank">Your Shot photo community.</a> The concept is to engage with photo talent from your audience and create content around specific topics or assignments. This inspired us at the Morning Sun to start a mid-Michigan photo community. We will use a Facebook group and blog to share images and communicate weekly assignments, tips and techniques. We will use these submitted pictures to curate photo galleries in our <a href="http://media.morningsun.com/" target="_blank">Media Center</a>. We will regularly feature our favorite submissions as the Morning Sun Facebook timeline image. The goal is to capture more images with beauty and emotion from our communities, beyond the typical reader-generated snapshots. We may even use some of that content in print, too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Collaborate with students on a sensor journalism project.</strong> One of the most exciting sessions I attended <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/sensor-journalism/#.UnqWppRga0Q" target="_blank">centered on sensor journalism</a>. This is an area of journalism that uses technology to collect data, often with participation from the public. <a href="https://twitter.com/jkeefe" target="_blank">John Keefe</a> from WNYC explained Radio Lab&#8217;s <a href="http://project.wnyc.org/cicadas/" target="_blank">cicada project</a>, which is an amazing example of sensor journalism. My long-term goal in sensor journalism is to collaborate with a group of elementary or middle school kids, and a local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" target="_blank">makerspace or hackerspace</a> (groups that find ways to create gadgets) on a sensor project. The starting point is to introduce the concept to a group of local students to come up with an interesting sensor project to tackle. The most popular lunch room table or playground equipment based on bodies and time spent are some ideas I had, but I want to discover what the students are interested in. Then, we could work with a makerspace to create the technology to measure, and create data-driven content from the collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>3. Apply data to our &#8220;Sound Off!&#8221; feature. </strong>The session &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/big-data-little-newsroom/#.UnrXppRga0Q" target="_blank">Big data, little newsroom</a>,&#8221; focused on methods and resources to get small newsrooms comfortable with the idea of data journalism. <a href="https://twitter.com/emmacarew" target="_blank">Emma Carew Grovum</a> shared helpful resources addressing issues for many journalists such as fear of math (I have this phobia) like this <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/slanews/conferences/sla2005/programs/mathcrib.htm" target="_blank">crib sheet</a> on basic data math formulas and this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BizJournalism" target="_blank">slideshow</a> (with homework!) for business journalism tips. I am going to start with something simple and clean (a tip I learned in the session). The Morning Sun has a daily feature called <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/opinion/20131004/sound-off-friday-saturday-oct-4-5" target="_blank">Sound Off</a>! where readers leave us a voicemail message anonymously expressing their opinion on whatever issue they want to &#8220;sound off&#8221; on. What I would like to do is track Sound Off each week and graph the number of calls on each topic, bringing to light what currently has our audience the most fired up and engaged.</p>
<p><strong>4. Create interactive timelines with Timeline JS.</strong> I discovered <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/timeline-js/#.UnrcVpRga0Q" target="_blank">Timeline JS</a> at ONA13 and this tool makes it ridiculously easy to create beautiful, interactive timelines. I am working on my first timeline this week, focused on the personal history of a family who is being disenrolled from the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe. Their story is part of a <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/general-news/20131104/tribal-judge-strips-four-and-40-descendants-of-membership" target="_blank">larger news issue</a> in which more than 10% of the tribe will be kicked out based on technical issues with record keeping in the 1800s. The timeline will help illustrate the somewhat confusing facts dealing with member payouts from casino profits, three different member rolls and families that can trace lineage back to the original members of the tribe, like Chief Pontiac. <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">Using Timeline JS</a> is as easy as copy-and-pasting info and links into an already-created spreadsheet. Try it out for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>5. Push newsroom to think &#8220;outside the article.&#8221;</strong> The session &#8220;<a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/broke-the-article-machine/#.Unrc7pRga0Q" target="_blank">Oops, we broke the article machine: Imagining what comes next,</a>&#8221; broke attendees into groups, gave them a news situation, and gave them one rule: Create a coverage plan without a traditional written article. The room was packed, the energy was amazing and the variety of concept ideas ranged from surveys, interactive games, clickable maps and databases. I plan to implement this concept with my co-workers, to challenge our concept of what the best method for telling any giving story is. With all the tools we have at our disposal in the digital age, why should we resort to presenting a story the same way newspapers did in the 1800s? This kind of brainstorming and forward-thinking is crucial to digital first newsrooms.<strong> </strong></p>
