				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/RICH_Visit_two-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="New Haven Register reporter Rich Scinto visited New York last week to train with the Thunderdome video team and learn some production tips he could take back to Connecticut." /></p><p>When New Haven Register reporter Rich Scinto turned up in the lobby of 5 Hanover Square last week, he came bearing a camera, a couple of lenses and the curiosity and enthusiasm it takes to learn something new.</p>
<p>The 80-mile journey was inspired by a simple idea: Scinto wanted to hone his video skills for the sake of his reporting.</p>
<p>After Scinto told Ben Doody, managing editor of JRC Connecticut, that he wanted to work on his video skills, Doody recommended that Scinoto visit Project Thunderdome for a hands-on crash course with the video team.</p>
<p>Rich and I went over the elements it takes to make solid video stories, reviewing a few well-executed video projects for inspiration before hitting the streets to practice shooting with the city of New York as the subject.</p>
<p>I handed Rich a list of specific types of shots and concepts that I wanted him to capture with the overall theme of ‘anticipation.</p>
<p>Scinto stretched and expanded his skills throughout the day, better learning his camera and editing software.</p>

<p>Working on fundamental concepts and taking the conversation back to the building blocks of how we process and capture moving pictures was refreshing for us both. And Rich was so open to the experience, instruction was easy.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, we had established the kind of working relationship that will be an asset to both Thunderdome and the New Haven Register going forward. We plan to be in touch in the coming weeks to help to ground the day’s lessons in the stories Rich will tackle for the Register.</p>
<p>“I noticed that my video filming techniques and editing skills improved significantly within the same day I trained at Thunderdome,” he said. “I’m excited to see how much more I can improve going forward with the great advice from the video crew at Thunderdome.”</p>
<p>Rich hasn&#8217;t wasted any time putting these lessons to work &#8212; not long after returning from New York, he helped livestream a debate among New Haven&#8217;s three declared mayoral candidates.</p>
