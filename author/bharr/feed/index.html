<p>There was a lot to take in from all the conference sessions and conversations I had <a title="#SNDLOU: Live updates from DFM’s Eileen Faust and Brian Harr" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/11/07/dfm-journalists-report-live-sndlou-workshop/">while at the SND conference last month</a>. There were many takeaways for me; collaboration, innovation — and yes — scaring your boss. Here’s a smattering of what I took away that can help us all focus on enhancing our storytelling:</p>
<h2><strong>Collaborate</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes we are islands. Working with others and doing it well is key to producing excellent journalism while at the same time putting energy into making others in the newsroom look better.</p>
<p>Many newsrooms already have a good working relationship with other departments. If not, develop a relationship with everyone, including and especially the digital staff. Even if your idea seems like a print-only idea, bring the digital folks into the process early on. And conversely, ask them to bring you into the process early on. It&#8217;s important to anticipate how the web and mobile presence of a project can increase the impact.</p>
<h2><strong>Innovate</strong></h2>
<p>Innovation should be important to every journalist, but it’s easy to get tripped up trying to follow trends. Falling into that can make us forget what we were trying to accomplish in the first place.</p>
<p>Innovate to solve problems, not to show off what you know.</p>
<p>As designers, especially for A1, the front page is still our biggest selling point. It’s a window to the rest of the paper. It all boils down to getting readers to read a story and so design is crucial. Letting design determine our front page content, however, is a concern. No matter how well it’s executed. It’s easy to over-photoshop or over-design. The question comes down to value. Are we helping or hurting the content by adding more to the design? Are we adding value to the content or just designing to be designing?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not passionate about your work and what you design, it’s evident to our readers. We need to demand more of ourselves and what we produce. We are in charge of protecting the integrity of our product.</p>

(Kenney Marlatt, @kenneymarlatt)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Scare your boss</b></h2>
<p>By far my favorite session from SND was from <a href="https://twitter.com/tmfrnk" target="_blank">Tim Frank</a> from the Asbury Park Design Studio. He tied together many of the recurring themes from the week. His session was titled “<a href="http://sndlouisville2013.sched.org/event/8d7bcdd091bff184166fd057ccbda8f5#.Up919WRDt2c" target="_blank">If you’re not scaring your boss, you’re not trying hard enough</a>.” Here’s a snapshot:</p>
<p>Quite often innovation in design is an act of subversion. This leads to questions from old-school editors asking, “How come you ran only two stories above the fold?” Or the photo editor questioning the photo edit.</p>
<p>Solving this begins with having it together. It’s not just, “Hey, what can we get away with?” To have the credibility to get away with something new you have to have your act together. Until you’re meeting deadline and things are running smoothly, you can’t ask to do outlandish things.</p>
<p>“There’s a fine line between an innovator and someone who’s just a pain in the butt,” Frank said.</p>
<p>In a different session I heard that handling A1 is often an entry-level position nowadays. While somewhat true, that doesn’t mean we can’t take charge of the page and act as the conductor. Articulate your ideas with fury. “This is the best solution, and I can tell you why!”</p>
<p>When it comes time to pitch something new or surprising, you want to already have a lot of trust built up with the decision makers. Without buy-in and collaboration, some great pages just won&#8217;t happen. Getting the editor and publisher to buy in to moving that ad on the back page so you can do a wrap with a photo around the front and back starts with good relationships.</p>
<p>But you can’t start huge. When you want to make changes, start small. Having established those relationships, then you can move on to scaring the boss.</p>
<h2><strong>Collaborated advice</strong></h2>
<p>Frank pulled together some nuggets of advice from great visual journalists around the world. Here they are in a mashup with some more verbs and stuff:</p>
<p><strong>You have to be able to articulate your ideas</strong>. Don’t present a half-baked design or presentation, let alone a half-baked idea. Before rushing in to your boss, get feedback from your colleague. They might see holes that you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipate what your boss would say. And not say</strong>. What the boss will not say might be your next option in case of rejection. If your idea is gunned down, don’t sulk. Quickly find another one. Think that there’s no best idea, only the best solution. If you introduce small changes as a progression toward what you want, things can happen. If you’re confident in your content. You don’t need to have X amount of things above the fold, or a story count, or anything like that &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Seize the day.</strong> When you don’t have anything to work with that’s when you have the biggest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>And some one liners, from Frank and others</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Your brain doesn’t pay attention to boring things.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be related to sex or outrageous. Just do amazing design.</p>
<p>Seduce your audience.</p>
<p>Sometimes you make a huge statement with what you don’t do.</p>
<p>You want to be the person that people want to listen to.</p>
<p>Make your arguments about the audience. “That’s a page that people will connect with.” It’s hard to argue against that.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[One of my favorite sessions at the conference was about the relationship between platform and content. Here are a few key takeaways.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/SND-PICK-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Taken from the 23rd floor of the Galt House Hotel." /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the first in a series of reports from two Digital First Media journalists who attended SND through the <a title="Digital First Represents #SND13: And the winner is …" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/10/18/digital-first-represents-snd13-winner/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program. </em></p>
<p>I returned to the <a href="http://www.dailynews.com" target="_blank">Daily News</a> newsroom from <a href="http://www.sndlou.com/" target="_blank">SND</a> <a title="#SNDLOU liveblog" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/live/sndlou-liveblog/" target="_blank">earlier this month</a> with a renewed vigor for my job as a designer and storyteller, and for doing it well. The experience was inspiring and challenging and it taught me that wherever I thought my design was before, there are countless levels still ahead of me.</p>
<p>SND reminded me how crucial design is to storytelling, especially in the digital age. It&#8217;s important for newsrooms to collaborate and involve designers from the earliest planning stages of any project. Using what I learned at SND earlier this month, I will be an advocate in my newsroom for improving the storytelling design across all platforms.</p>
<p>To that end, one of my favorite sessions at the conference was led by Twitter&#8217;s David Wright (<a href="https://twitter.com/dwjr">@dwjr</a>). The subject covered the relationship between platform and content. Among other things, he explained why &#8220;designers are uniquely qualified to solve some of the toughest problems facing newsrooms today.&#8221; Here are a few key takeaways:</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Know the differences between platforms<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Understanding the difference between platforms is essential to creating good work. Content design and platform design are very different animals. Here&#8217;s a quick compare and contrast:</span></span></p>
<p><em>Content</em> is exploratory, specific, custom and involves storytelling and pacing. It all adds up to the perfect page.</p>
<p><em>Platform</em> is rigid, general, template-driven and involves distribution and wayfinding. It all adds up to the perfect system.</p>
<p>Content thinks, &#8220;<em>How am I going to tell the story?</em>&#8221;<br />
Platform thinks, &#8220;<em>How am I going to distribute it?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Content asks, &#8220;<em>What is the best way to tell this story?</em>&#8221;<br />
Platform asks, &#8220;<em>What problem am I helping this reader solve?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/platform.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5047" alt="" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/platform.jpg" width="800" height="531" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Identify the problems</strong><br />
Design has an important roll in fixing broken platforms. Digital news design, for the most part, is still broken with many story pages feeling the same.</p>
<p>Pages are often filled with unnecessary junk, and things don&#8217;t work on mobile as intended.</p>
<p>A common problem is <em>overclutter</em> on news sites. How does the user know what’s important if everything’s important?</p>
<p>Display advertising is a completely failing business model. We have not been good stewards in our relationship with readers and display advertising.</p>
<p>A lot of things we currently produce don’t work on all platforms, so we run in to, “Sorry, you can&#8217;t watch this or play that on your iPad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Identifying the problems is the first step to solving them. If we ask ourselves what problems we can solve, the result is a better model than reacting to drops in readership.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your competition?</strong><br />
Pop quiz: Who do you think your competitive set is?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to sit in our cubicles with headphones on, and avoid our neighbors. A healthy workplace and environment is one that includes talking and challenging each other. Don’t limit your views of who your competition is or what your standards could be. We need to change our perception of competitive sets.</p>
<p>Why is Gmail so competitive? It is ubiquitous. Anyplace we go we have our Gmail.<br />
That’s also how our news should be.</p>
<p>Anything that we do should match the experience of what Gmail can do.</p>
<p><strong>Make connections</strong><br />
Our goal is to connect with visitors, and create relationships with them. Our goal is to have site visitors stay and hang around for more. Design plays a crucial role in helping news organizations make digital products that are inviting and engaging.</p>
<p>The battle for audience retention will be fought on platform. Platform design plays a crucial role in helping news organizations make effective digital products that will keep readers coming back, again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Find context</strong><br />
Design thinking can help by using context, research, empathy (user-centered) and synthesis.<br />
We get context by doing research. We research by observing people. The people we want to help are the ones we need to watch. Reaching them means going to where they are. We have to talk to these people. The research helps create empathy as we connect with the people. Watching helps you understand their friction points. The end result is finding context through the analysis of all of these observations.</p>
<p><strong>Sound bites<br />
</strong><em>A few other key takeaways I got from this session: </em><strong><br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">• Good experiences thrive in organizations where design is respected.<br />
</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">• Visual journalists are ready-made problem solvers.<br />
</span>• Observation helps challenge the status-quo.<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">• User tastes change and it’s effected by technology.<br />
</span>• It’s critical to pay attention, because we may be spending too much time in the wrong spots.<br />
• Google is free<br />
• Show, don’t tell<br />
• Users don’t hit the “back to top” button.<br />
• Design has to be a relentless advocate for good user experience.</p>
