(Twentieth Century Fox)</p></div>
<p>Since last summer, the <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com" target="_blank">El Paso Times</a> has had to keep its newfound celebrity under wraps.  Now, with the release of Ridley Scott&#8217;s latest film, <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2193215/" target="_blank">The Counselor</a>, </i>the El Paso Times can admit to sharing screen time with the likes of Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender and Cameron Diaz.</p>
<p>At the time of the film&#8217;s release in October, El Paso Times editor <a href="https://twitter.com/BobMooreNews" target="_blank">Bob Moore</a> had this to say on his Facebook page:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now that &#8220;The Counselor&#8221; has opened, I&#8217;m free from a non-disclosure agreement and can explain a photo that surfaced last summer. The Times was approached by the producers to provide a newspaper with a specific headline that would be important to the plot. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/carlita.montoya.3?directed_target_id=0">Carlita Montoya</a> produced the design and Armando Durazo wrote the text of the story (working on guidance from the producers.)”</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="wp-image-5174 alignright" alt="" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/bradpitt.jpg" width="240" height="262" />The photo Moore refers to is this snapshot of Brad Pitt holding an issue of the Times that was specially created for the film&#8217;s production. This image was released by producers of <i>The Counselor</i> in the summer of 2012 to build buzz around the film.</p>
<p>The film is written by celebrated novelist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy" target="_blank">Cormac McCarthy</a>, his first original screenplay for a Hollywood movie. McCarthy also lived in El Paso for a while, just around the corner from Moore in fact, though Moore says he never met the notoriously reclusive writer.</p>
<p>Filming took place in El Paso last summer and that’s when the Times was approached by Jonathan Boreham who represented The Counselor&#8217;s film company.</p>
<p>“­­­­He said part of the script included a newspaper headline that moved the plot along. He asked if the producers could use the El Paso Times rather than a generic newspaper,” said Moore.</p>
<p><strong>How they produced the &#8216;Counselor&#8217; edition of the Times</strong><br />
The Times received very specific instructions from the producers of the film. They were asked to produce a front page with a strip lead of a death in New Mexico (the headline was written for them). The Times was also asked for a photograph of a police car on a dirt road with yellow police tape. Senior editors Carlita Montoya and Armando Durazo took charge of the project. Montoya produced the design and Durazo wrote the text of the article.</p>
<p><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/elpaso.jpg"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/elpaso.jpg" width="364" height="303" /></a></p>
<p>“I produced a page that met those requirements for him. Additionally, I produced several prototypes for him with minor tweaks,” said Montoya, of the faux paper. “In the final communication, he asked that we remove skybox photos that had people or companies in them for litigious reasons.”</p>
<p>When Durazo was given the front page story from the production company, he insisted the Times re-write the piece on the event as a hard-hitting news story.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he saw their version, he said, &#8216;Hell no, we&#8217;re going to do a news story.&#8217;&#8221; Said Montoya. &#8220;For a byline, he used a combination of his family members.&#8221;</p>
<p>“You can’t see it on the screen, obviously, but it was kind of cool to add that sort of realism,” said Moore of the final product.</p>
<p>The Times printed this special edition of the paper after a regular newspaper run. One-hundred copies were bundled and given to crew who worked on the film as mementos.</p>
<p>Catch another glimpse of the paper in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ML50I0mVHY" target="_blank">international trailer for &#8216;The Counselor&#8217;</a> at the 1:22 mark.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the Times&#8217; only brush with Hollywood this year either. The FX series &#8216;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2406376/" target="_blank">The Bridge</a>&#8216; was also set in El Paso, featuring a number of appearances by the newspaper and <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com" target="_blank">ElPasoTimes.com</a> in the first season.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the secondary characters in the show was referred to in the pilot as &#8216;that dickwad reporter from the El Paso Times.&#8217; We loved it.&#8221; says Moore.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Berkshire Eagle has been sharing their Tout videos with WNYT Channel 13 in a partnership that seems to paying off for both newsrooms.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/berkshirecap-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="berkshirecap" /></p><p>The folks at the <a href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/" target="_blank">Berkshire Eagle</a> are heavy <a href="http://www.tout.com/" target="_blank">Tout</a> users. For the past few months, they’ve been sharing their Touts with <a href="http://wnyt.com/index.shtml" target="_blank">WNYT Channel 13</a>, Albany’s largest television station, in a partnership that seems to be paying off for both newsrooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seized upon the opportunity to promote our stories and brand within this larger Albany market. We suggested they look at our Touts for the video aspect of our coverage,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/iamberkshire" target="_blank">Kevin Moran</a>, Regional VP of news for New England Newspapers, Inc.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4754 alignright" alt="vzsnms64yqgzdg55ieba copy" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/vzsnms64yqgzdg55ieba-copy.jpg" width="174" height="173" /></p>
<p>Moran explains how Touts are already a part of newsroom protocol at the Berkshire Eagle. &#8221;The news, sports and features folks​ here at The Eagle have taken to Tout videos because they are providing that extra layer of informational texture — the real-life, &#8216;see it straight from the source or at the source&#8217; visual impact — to their reporting. We&#8217;re also trying to embed as many of these Touts into related stories to add that video depth.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Pittsfield City Councilor Paul Capitanio was facing conspiracy charges this August, The Berkshire Eagle published a Tout of the councilor, and his wife, as they headed to the courthouse for their hearing.</p>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/dqpqvd" height="388" width="420" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The Tout video was an exclusive; the perfect perp-walk clip of Capitanio. WNYT quickly reached out to the Eagle to <a href="http://pittsfield.wnyt.com/news/crime/446372-pittsfield-councilman-facing-charges">use the clip in their own news spot</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/cs_api/iframe?auto_next=0&amp;auto_start=0&amp;page_count=1&amp;pl_id=8178&amp;show_title=0&amp;va_id=4233485&amp;windows=1" height="330" width="425" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“They hadn&#8217;t heard of Tout, but were immediately impressed with the instantaneous nature of the video platform. And because our reporters are embedded within our community, we have the best short-form video reporting around. WNYT knows that,” said Moran.</p>
<p>Since then, WNYT Channel 13 has used multiple Touts from the Berkshire Eagle in their televised reports. Including <a href="http://pittsfield.wnyt.com/news/news/361542-rescue-crews-locate-missing-swimmer-berkshire-county">this spot</a> following rescue crews as they search for a missing swimmer in Berkshire County.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/cs_api/iframe?auto_next=0&amp;auto_start=0&amp;page_count=1&amp;pl_id=8178&amp;show_title=0&amp;va_id=4116727&amp;windows=1" height="330" width="425" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“Generally, we&#8217;ve found no reason to say no so far, and I cannot anticipate when or why we would. WNYT is cognizant of making sure that if we have an exclusive, they present it as such,” said Moran.</p>
<p>Attribution is an important part of the agreement. According to Moran, there are rules WNYT has to follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;When WNYT wants to use a clip off one of our Touts, they email for an OK. Indeed they keep The Berkshire Eagle watermark on the video and in a couple instances have also added a banner that says The Berkshire Eagle. We ask that they do a verbal direct to BerkshireEagle.com in the segment and we may ask that be changed in their banner to BerkshireEagle.com,&#8221; said Moran.</p>
<p><i> </i>So far, the partnership is a win-win for everyone involved.</p>
<p>“People still watch TV and The Eagle has found an &#8216;in&#8217; with a major market traditional TV station through our Tout ​videos​, and we have a good relationship to be able to draw content from them as well — such as regional news stories or what have you — on our site​,” said Moran.</p>
<p><em><b>JOIN THE DISCUSSION</b><br />
</em>The Berkshire Eagle isn&#8217;t the first local news site to collaborate with a local TV station. What are some other best practices or encouraging examples of local news organizations working together to cover the community? What are some guidelines that need to be followed? Have your Touts or videos been embedded or picked up by other organizations? Tell us in the comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/AP923506093249-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Vicki Maturo, of Culver City, Calif., protests against the government shutdown which started a day earlier, outside the federal building in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2013 (AP Photo/Jae C.

<p>The government may have shut down, but Thunderdome was just warming up.</p>
<p>Through the 16 days of the government shutdown, Thunderdome&#8217;s news desk provided a constantly-updated live blog (embedded below) to track every major development for readers of Digital First Media properties. The liveblog provided readers with vital, real-time updates and insight on the debt ceiling, the Capitol Hill shooting on Oct. 3, <a href="https://vine.co/v/hwUwpi0jjqV" target="_blank">shutdown beards</a> and angry stenographers, among other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The effort was spear-headed by one of our most recent additions to the team, politics reporter/producer <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/aphillips/" target="_blank">Amber Phillips</a>, along with help from <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/phogan/" target="_blank">Patrick Hogan</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jsederholm/" target="_blank">Jillian Sederholm</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/chopkins/" target="_blank">Chris Hopkins</a>, <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/kworkman/" target="_blank">Karen Workman</a> and <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/jwestfall/" target="_blank">Julie Westfall</a> of the breaking news desk, and some technical help from live channel manager <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/cmarch/" target="_blank">Chris March</a>.</p>
<p>The liveblog was produced with <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com" target="_blank">ScribbleLive</a>, the tool Digital First Media properties use for real-time publishing of breaking news liveblogs and chats. The liveblog found an even larger audience outside of Digital First Media through ScribbleLive&#8217;s <a href="https://market.scribblelive.com/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>. <a href="http://live.mprnews.org/Event/Prelude_to_a_Government_Shutdown?Page=0" target="_blank">Minnesota Public Radio</a>, Sun Media, <a href="http://live.boston.com/Event/Following_the_government_shutdown_-_live_blog?Page=0" target="_blank">Boston.com</a>, local news sites in Wisconsin and <a href="http://live.siouxcityjournal.com/Event/Live_Shots_at_Capitol_Hill?Page=0" target="_blank">Sioux City</a> and a handful of other media outlets syndicated the content for use on their own websites. It even made it across the pond, spotted on websites in <a href="http://livestudio.nettavisen.no/Event/USA-nedstengingen?Page=0" target="_blank">Norway</a> and <a href="http://www.lesoir.be/341406/article/actualite/monde/2013-10-16/etats-unis-republicains-et-democrates-trouvent-un-accord-pour-sortir-crise" target="_blank">France</a>. These media sites were able to syndicate our liveblog content for free (we have option to charge a fee for use), and localize it or add their own content to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is great stuff and a testament to the hard work of the politics and breaking teams and a good model for how to handle these kind of sustained news events in the future,&#8221; says Politics Channel Manager <a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/author/rbeckwith/" target="_blank">Ryan Beckwith</a>.</p>
<p>The liveblog remained &#8216;open&#8217; throughout the duration of the government shutdown, tallying 105,000 unique visitors, according to our analytics from ScribbleLive. About half of that viewership came from Digital First Media sites, with the other half from syndication. More impressive is the amount of time viewers spent on the page once getting there &#8211; an average of 12 minutes per view.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know how long the shutdown would last when we started the liveblog,&#8221; says March. &#8220;But by maintaining it throughout the shutdown, this allowed Digital First Media sites to always have the latest on their websites for their readers without having to update anything. We took care of keeping the space fresh, relevant and informative so they didn&#8217;t have to.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>What did you think of the liveblog, Digital First? What did you appreciate most? What can we do to improve our coverage of national breaking news for local websites? </em></p>
