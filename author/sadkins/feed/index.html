<p>Late last year, a worker at York Hospital (in Pennsylvania) erroneously injected a patient with radioactive white blood cells, a pharmaceutical designed to detect infections.</p>
<p>Aside from some minor swelling, the patient showed no ill effects. The patient received the same level of radiation a person receives in a year from the natural environment.</p>
<p>Much of my <a href="http://www.ydr.com/business/ci_24891937/" target="_blank">reporting</a> for that story came from data that I pulled from U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>At the time, I was not aware of the Association of Health Care Journalists&#8217; <a href="http://www.hospitalinspections.org/" target="_blank">website</a> — a repository of hospital reviews sorted by area.</p>
<h1>Data improves health coverage</h1>
<p>During his turn at the NICAR 2014 microphone, <a href="https://twitter.com/byPeterEisler" target="_blank">Peter Eisler</a> of USA Today took those who attended the &#8220;Wading through the sea of data of hospitals, doctors, medicine and more&#8221; session on a tour of this website and that of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>Using tips passed along by Eisler, I learned that officials had uncovered a medical screening exam violation at a local hospital — data that could lead to a follow-up to my original story.</p>
<p>Both Eisler and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/dan-keating/2012/09/27/8207c022-08ca-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_page.html" target="_blank">Dan Keating</a> of The Washington Post explained ways to download the <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare" target="_blank">physician compare database.</a></p>
<p>For example, with the help of ArcView and U.S. Census data shape files, I can map doctors by their age, specialty and school in which they graduated. Taking income data, I can layer the map to show where younger/older doctors practice. Such a map could also do the same for specialities.</p>
<p>Do plastic surgeons practice in more affluent areas of the York County area? What sections of York County are home to the fewest doctors?</p>
<h1>Data improves public housing coverage</h1>
<p>Mapping, as I learned in mini boot camp at NICAR, can and should be applied to multiple topics.</p>
<p>Tim Henderson pointed out in his <a href="http://slid.es/timhenderson/section8">session</a> — &#8221;How to uncover inequity and swindlers in subsidized housing programs near you&#8221; — that maps would be the ideal way to show the disbursement of the public housing across an area.</p>
<p>After haggling with HUD for Section 8 housing data, Henderson said he was able not only to produce a map of public housing, but he also painted a clear picture of an economically distressed area.</p>
<p>He was able to use census data to gauge minority population and rental percentages to peer into the the availability of the affordable housing in a given area.</p>
<p>What Henderson found was that areas with little or no Section 8 housing and few rentals may discourage affordable housing. Also, he recommended looking at minority census tracts and mapping the affordable housing options.</p>
<h1>Data improves education coverage</h1>
<p>Full disclosure: I&#8217;m not an education writer. Sure, I&#8217;ve covered school-related stories as they&#8217;ve crossed into my beat, but my focus has never been standardized tests or the mapping of school bus routes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s going to change.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/coulterjones" target="_blank">Coulter Jones</a> of WNYC New York Public Radio pointed out some great ideas for education-related stories that I plan to report.</p>
<p>For example, during his session, Jones suggested that journalists request attendance records. This data may be used to check fire alarm/student ratios and which schools have the worst problems with attendance.</p>
<p>He urged us to request the records of school bus drivers, such as accident reports and criminal histories.</p>
<p>Another good suggestion was to overlay health inspection data with school attendance to see if students are getting sick after a failed inspection.</p>
<p><em>Why stop there? That&#8217;s just a look at how data can improve Sean&#8217;s beat coverage. Check out Chrys Wu&#8217;s compendium of <a href="http://blog.chryswu.com/2014/02/21/nicar14-slides-tutorials-links-tools/" target="_blank">slides and handouts from NICAR</a> to see how data can help upgrade your beat.  </em></p>
