<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='624' height='381' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kFxpdn5iq8Q?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Though the genesis of Thunderdome&#8217;s name is based on a quip that Washington Post publisher Katharine Weymouth made while showing a particularly Spartan part of The Post’s old newsroom to Digital First CEO John Paton, there are actually a number of similarities between the movie and our New York newsroom.</p>
<p>To wit, the top four ways in which Thunderdome is like Thunderdome.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the movie, Thunderdome is a huge cage within Bartertown, an oasis in the Australian desert of some technology and little civilization. The DFM version is a big room in a Lower Manhattan office building, nestled in an oasis of sorts that had its start in the 17th century as a Dutch fur trading post. So, practically the same place!</li>
<li>In Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the residents of Bertertown are occasionally subjected to energy embargoes; similarly, the journalists at Thunderdome sometimes have to abide by news embargoes imposed by sources and other organizations.</li>
<li>Mad Max and his combatants have an assortment of knives, guns, axes, crossbows, chainsaws, and other weaponry with which to wage battle. Here at the more peaceful version of Thunderdome, we too have a number of tools we use to ply our craft. In our case, these implements include curation tools like <a href="http://www.storify.com">Storify</a>, <a href="http://www.spundge.com/">Spundge</a> and <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com/">ScribbleLive</a>, sharing technologies like <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org">DocumentCloud</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>, and storytelling tools like <a href="http://timeline.verite.co/">TimelineJS</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</li>
<li>When Mad Max does battle in Thunderdome, the inhabitants of Bartertown chant the mantra, “Two men enter, one man leaves.” Nothing so bloodthirsty goes on here, but when I first told friends I was taking the job with Thunderdome, I heard far too many “Two content management systems enter, one CMS leaves.” jokes. (In truth, one such joke is too many. Don’t tell my clever friends.)</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, so it isn’t a perfect analogy. But our somewhat more civilized Thunderdome is here to fight the good fight on behalf of local newsrooms throughout the Digital First network.</p>
