		<description><![CDATA[February's DFMie-winning journalism ranges from coverage of a nuclear waste leak to an effort to identify people in old photos to exposing excessive pay of a school superintendent. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/10/dfmies620x4001-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="dfmies620x400" /></p><p>February&#8217;s DFMie-winning journalism ranged from coverage of a nuclear waste leak to an effort to identify people in old photos to exposing excessive pay of a school superintendent.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a break down of the month&#8217;s winners. See below for more details on each.</p>
<h3>Watchdog journalism</h3>
<p><strong>Metro Division</strong>: <strong>Rob Kuznia</strong> of the Daily Breeze in Torrance, Calif., won the Metro DFMie for revealing that a school superintendent in a small district was making nearly double the compensation of the superintendent of the Los Angeles School District.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado/Utah Division</strong>: <strong>Erica Meltzer</strong> of the Daily Camera won the DFMie for non-metro newsrooms in Colorado and Utah for reporting on surveillance cameras watching homeless people in Boulder.</p>
<p><strong>Midwest Division</strong>: <strong>The Michigan newsrooms</strong> won the Midwest DFMie for a project on declining property values in the state.</p>
<h3>News coverage</h3>
<p><strong>Northeast Division</strong>:<strong> Andrew Amelinckx</strong> of the Berkshire Eagle won the Northeast DFMie for live coverage of a triple murder trial.</p>
<p><strong>Texas/New Mexico Division</strong>: <strong>The Carlsbad Current-Argus</strong> won the Texas/New Mexico DFMie for coverage of a fire and leak at a nuclear waste repository.</p>
<h3>Sports coverage</h3>
<p><strong>Los Angeles News Group Division</strong>: The Los Angeles News Group DFMie went to team coverage of signing day for high school football players agreeing to college scholarships.</p>
<p><strong>Bay Area News Group Division</strong>: Graphic artist <strong>Jeff Durham</strong> and sports columnist <strong>Marcus Thompson</strong> won the Bay Area News Group DFMie for their analysis of the &#8220;Picture Perfect&#8221; shot of Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry.</p>
<h3>Community Engagement</h3>
<p><strong>Northern California Division</strong>: The <strong>Vallejo Times-Herald</strong> won the Northern California DFMie for a Valentine&#8217;s engagement project.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia Division</strong>: <strong>Matt Murphy</strong> and<strong> Billy Wolfe</strong> of the Charleston Daily Mail won in the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/West Virginia cluster for a community engagement project to identify the people in the portraits found in an old photo studio.</p>
<h3>Tout Bout</h3>
<p><a href="http://wp.me/p2SLaZ-2gs" target="_blank">ToutBout winners were announced in this separate post</a>.</p>
<h3>Judging</h3>
<p>Judges for the February DFMies and ToutBout were the <a title="January DFMies: Gun-control coverage, scandals, multimedia and more" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2013/03/18/january-dfmies-feature-gun-control-coverage-scandals-multimedia-packages/" target="_blank">January winners</a> (including representatives from staff winners): Daniel Tedford, Daniel Aitken, Harrison Sheppard, Dana Bartholomew, John McCoy, Carolina Garcia, Miriam Vasquez, Tom Tripicco, Nathan Mayberg, Ben Garver, Dave Boucher, Matt Murphy, Marcus Costentino, Stephanie Metzger, Eric Bonzar, Sarah Kuta, Kevin Johnson, Zack Ponce, Karl Mondon, John Valenzuela, Jim Harrington, Chuck Barney, Julie Jag and Stephen Baxter.</p>
<p>Judges have no input on the judging for their own clusters. So, for instance, Murphy and Ponce were not involved in judging the winning entries that they worked on. They&#8217;re just on a roll.</p>
<p>Details on the February winners follow. We&#8217;re inviting the winners to tweet lessons from their winning projects and will update with the tweets as they post them:</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.142857143rem; line-height: 1.846153846;">Rob Kuznia dug into superintendent&#8217;s pay</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Fernandez.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8684 aligncenter" alt="Illustration for Daily Breeze superintendent story" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Fernandez.jpg" width="637" height="486" /></a>The total compensation for Centinela Valley Union High School District Superintendent Jose Fernandez was hidden in opaque contract language, but <a title="@RobKuznia" href="https://twitter.com/RobKuznia" target="_blank">Kuznia</a> decoded it with the help of a school finance expert. The resulting <a title="Daily Breeze investigation of Centinela superintendent pay" href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/centinela-valley-investigation">stories</a>, showing that the small-school district was paying its superintendent more than double the total compensation of the Los Angeles superintendent.</p>
<p>Kuznia&#8217;s reporting prompted an <a title="Centinela Valley School District emergency meeting" href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/social-affairs/20140225/live-centinela-valley-high-school-district-emergency-meeting">emergency school board meeting</a> and <a href="http://asmdc.org/members/a66/news-room/press-releases/assemblymember-muratsuchi-introduces-legislation-to-prevent-excessive-school-administrator-compensation">proposed legislation to prevent such excessive pay</a> in the future.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why we are journalists: Holding accountable this public entity that is clearly out of touch is at the very core of our profession and illustrates the value of a newspaper — or media organization — to its community.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Andrew Amelinckx liveblogged murder trial</h3>
<div id="attachment_8628" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/andrew-amelinckx/" rel="attachment wp-att-8628"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8628" alt="Andrew Amelinckx" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Andrew-Amelinckx-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Amelinckx</p></div>
<p><a title="Andrew Amelinckx" href="https://twitter.com/BE_TheAmelinckx">Andrew Amelinckx</a> of the Eagle won for his l<a title="Adam Lee Hall murder trial live coverage" href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_24853252">ive coverage of the triple-murder trial of Adam Lee Hall,</a> a reputed Hells Angel. As <a href="http://www.berkshireeagleblogs.com/unbolts/2014/03/26/unbolt-1552145-engagement-minutes/">Kevin Moran, vice president for news at New England Newspapers, recounted in a blog post about the trial</a>, it drew 25,855 engagement hours from more than 53,000 unique visitors, averaging 21 minutes a visit. To get an idea of how many hours that is, Moran says, think of it as working a 40-hour week for 12 1/2 years with no vacation. Moran also blogged an <a title="Liveblogging tips" href="http://www.berkshireeagleblogs.com/unbolts/2014/04/04/unbolt-tips-for-live-blogging-a-big-trial/">interview with Amelinckx about liveblogging tips</a>.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrew gets major bonus points for his industriousness, aggressiveness and persistence, not to mention his digital-first willingness to learn a new skill (ScribbleLive). I admired the way he tirelessly filed updates throughout the trial, keeping his readers (and the community) informed.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Erica Meltzer reported on surveillance of homeless</h3>
<div id="attachment_8624" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/erica-meltzer1x1/" rel="attachment wp-att-8624"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8624" alt="Erica Meltzer" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Erica-Meltzer1x1-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Erica Meltzer</p></div>
<p>A <a title="Boulder City Council story by Erica Meltzer" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_25119409">brief exchange at a Boulder City Council meeting</a> prompted <a title="Erica Meltzer" href="https://twitter.com/meltzere">Meltzer</a> to seek public records and push for answers. Two days after the meeting, Meltzer broke the news that the c<a title="Boulder admits to downtown surveillance program" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_25136880">ity was operating surveillance cameras in downtown Boulder</a>.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gleaned by a keen ear and a public records request, the story highlights the best in watchdog journalism. It also forced city officials and police to admit to clandestine peeping and the purchase of $8,000 in surveillance equipment, sparking a local debate about civil rights.</p></blockquote>
<h3>A &#8216;Picture Perfect&#8217; winner</h3>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/ssjm0215mtcurry90online/" rel="attachment wp-att-8688"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8688" alt="Jeff Durham graphic of Stephen Curry's shot" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Curry-graphic-1024x679.jpg" width="625" height="414" /></a></p>

<p>Artist <a title="Jeff Durham" href="https://twitter.com/JeffDurham">Jeff Durham</a> and columnist <a title="Marcus Thompson" href="https://twitter.com/ThompsonScribe">Marcus Thompson</a> collaborated on a <a title="San Jose Mercury News graphic" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/portlet/article/html/imageDisplay.jsp?contentItemRelationshipId=5730370">graphic</a> and <a title="Thompson: Stephen Curry's consistency is key to his shot" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_25133842">column</a> explaining why the Golden State Warriors&#8217; Stephen Curry is such a successful jump shooter.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comment:</p>
<blockquote><p> The nearly scientific analysis of his shooting technique is remarkable and unusual for sports coverage. The graphic pulled me in and the prose was thorough and took me by surprise.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Charleston photo project wins</h3>
<div id="attachment_8618" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/billy-wolfe/" rel="attachment wp-att-8618"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8618" alt="Billy Wolfe" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/BILLY-Wolfe-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Billy Wolfe</p></div>
<p>After Lindsay Hignite died in 2000, Lindsay&#8217;s Studio in East Charleston never reopened. When the Charleston Urban Renewal Authority bought the building last fall, workers found thousands of prints of portraits of Charleston people. <a title="Matt Murphy" href="https://twitter.com/DMLocalGov">Matt Murphy</a> and Billy Wolfe of the Charleston Daily Mail got to work trying to identify and match the photos with their subjects or family members, using a <a title="Charleston Daily Mail photo gallery of old portraits" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151939133851272.1073741849.17795641271&amp;type=3">Facebook photo gallery</a> that has been shared more than 200 times.</p>
<div id="attachment_8619" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/matt-murphy/" rel="attachment wp-att-8619"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8619" alt="Matt Murphy" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Matt-Murphy-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt Murphy</p></div>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Charleston Daily Mail used ingenuity to take what would seem like a daunting task and turned it into an impactful, digital project that touches the very core of their readers. Using Facebook as the medium, the staff created a digital database of their community&#8217;s past with these photos and, in essence, collaborated with their readers to tell this story.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Another Vallejo engagement winner</h3>
<p><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/now-thats-love/" rel="attachment wp-att-8694"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8694" alt="Vallejo Times-Herald Now That's Love logo" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Now-Thats-Love.jpg" width="200" height="182" /></a>Fresh off their <a title="Seven repeat winners in November DFMies and ToutBout awards" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/01/06/november-dfmies-breaking-news-enterprise-engagement-sports-storytelling/">November DFMie win</a> for their Generation Snaps engagement project, Lanz Christian Bañes and Chris Riley of the Times-Herald teamed with colleague Irma Widjojo for a Valentine&#8217;s engagement project, Now That&#8217;s Love. They collected stories, poems and other romantic reflections from the community, then opened the submissions up to voting. The journalists did video and text stories on the <a title="Puppy love" href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_25142589">three</a> <a title="Vallejo single mom raises three kids with love" href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_25142582">winning</a> <a title="Couple answers love's call" href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_25142572">entries</a>.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vignettes stand on their own as show-not-tell illustrations of the greatest human (and even canine) attribute. Very lean. Very tight. Very lovingly written. And a great job at good old-fashioned storytelling.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Michigan property values project</h3>
<p>A team from all DFM newsrooms in Michigan collaborated on an analysis of falling property values, showing that the decline appears to have bottomed out in southeastern Michigan. The project included stories by <a title="Oakland Press property values story" href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20140214/falling-property-values-may-have-bottomed-out-in-most-communities">Charlie Crumm</a>, <a title="News-Herald property value story" href="http://www.thenewsherald.com/articles/2014/02/16/news/doc52fe785756c73691603524.txt">Erica McClain</a>, <a title="Ann Arbor Journal property values story" href="http://www.heritage.com/articles/2014/02/17/ann_arbor_journal/news/doc53015c8050214819082692.txt">Nichole Seguin</a> and <a title="Macomb Daily property value story" href="http://www.macombdaily.com/government-and-politics/20140214/macomb-county-posts-solid-gains-in-property-values">Norb Franz</a> and a <a title="Google Fusion map" href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col2+from+19X9CQZ3ZT_9g1So9mKG3_IaNsnwnKkuKvZnFoBk&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=42.554879708009544&amp;lng=-83.38927282421879&amp;t=1&amp;z=9&amp;l=col2&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=GEOCODABLE">Google Fusion map by McClain</a>. Others contributing to the project were by Michelle Rogers, John Turk, Lara Stump, Gina Joseph, Kevin Martin, Randi Shaffer and Lisa Jonaitis.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The story and online maps take a complex issue and break it into easily digested maps and pieces of information. The story&#8217;s format recognized the way people outside journalism consume information now — not always in written form. More data should be presented this way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Sports coverage of signing day</h3>
<div id="attachment_6593" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/06/december-dfmies-show-variety-sports-coverage/scott-wolf/" rel="attachment wp-att-6593"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6593" alt="Scott Wolf" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/02/Scott-Wolf-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scott Wolf</p></div>
<p>The Los Angeles News Group&#8217;s <a title="National signing day coverage" href="http://www.presstelegram.com/national-signing-day">coverage of signing day</a> for football players heading to college included a liveblog, photo galleries, player biographies and a constantly updated database of signings involving UCLA, USC and local areas. The coverage generated 275,000 page views. The liveblog alone had 970,000 engagement minutes. Journalists driving the coverage were USC beat writer Scott Wolf, UCLA beat writer Jack Wang, High School Sports Editor Fred Robledo and Programmer Phil Lawrence. Wolf&#8217;s USC coverage won the <a title="3 sports coverage tips from December’s DFMie winners" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/02/07/december-dfmies-sports/">LANG DFMie for December</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_8699" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/phil-lawrence/" rel="attachment wp-att-8699"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8699" alt="Phil Lawrence" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Lawrence-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Phil Lawrence</p></div>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was impressed by the throughness of the project. There are a lot of people throughout the country who pay close attention to college athletics, and it appears the staff was able to harness that interest for the benefit of their audience.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Current-Argus coverage of nuclear leak</h3>
<div id="attachment_8762" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/04/14/february-dfmie-winners/current-argus-group-photo/" rel="attachment wp-att-8762"><img class="size-large wp-image-8762" alt="The Current-Argus staff, from left: Jessica Onsurez, Zack Ponce, Jonathan Smith, Martha Mauritson and Brandon Bowers." src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/04/current-argus-group-photo-1024x768.jpg" width="625" height="468" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Current-Argus staff, from left: Jessica Onsurez, Zack Ponce, Jonathan Smith, Martha Mauritson and Brandon Bowers.</p></div>
<p>The fire and radiation leak at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant 26 miles east of Carlsbad were the most serious incidents in the plant&#8217;s 15-year history, exposing 13 workers to radiation. The <a title="Current-Argus coverage of nuclear leak" href="http://www.currentargus.com/wipp">Current-Argus coverage</a> was led by reporter Zack Ponce with contributions from Jessica Onsurez, Jon Smith and Martha Mauritson.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>My vote is for the staff of the Carlsbad Current-Argus. I especially liked their use of Tout, Twitter and ScribbleLive to keep people updated on the story, and also their commitment to digging deeper through the use of FOIAs. These stories have my vote because the reporters are acting as watchdogs in this scenario and that&#8217;s a service to the community. Also, it&#8217;s just stellar journalism.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sulek of the Bay Area News Group wins the Tout Bout for her <a title="This 95-year-old vet goes viral with San Jose Mercury News video" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/05/95-year-old-vet-viral-san-jose-mercury-news-video/" target="_blank">viral video</a> of runners detouring from a race course to shake hands with a veteran cheering them on. The video, which was played on TV networks, has more than 1.4 million views.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Her Tout brought tears to my eyes, and I think represents why we do what we do as reporters. She was on the ground, amongst &#8220;the people,&#8221; capturing spontaneous moments as they happen. If she had been standing at the finish line waiting for the race to end, she would&#8217;ve missed this moment entirely.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Matt Goul, York Daily Record<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><br />
</span></h3>

<p>The York Daily Record&#8217;s Goul wins for his GameTimePA basketball buzzer-beater video, capturing the in-bounds pass, the winning shot and the resulting celebration (one of three buzzer beaters nominated).</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The video tells a complete story with action and emotion.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Sean Hiller, Los Angeles News Group</h3>
<p><iframe id="tout_embed" src="//www.tout.com/embed/touts/w25qij" height="428" width="620" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Hiller of the Los Angeles News Group wins for his &#8220;<a title="Kelp Watch 2014" href="http://www.presstelegram.com/environment-and-nature/20140306/kelp-watch-2014-cal-state-long-beach-marine-biologists-look-at-effects-of-fukushima-fallout">Kelp Watch</a>&#8221; video about marine biologists studying local effects of the damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant.</p>
<p>A judge&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Professional video and camera work, great editing, nice multi camera angles and great explanation by speaker.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Two errors and Tout Bout hits &#8220;pause&#8221;</h3>
<p>The selection of three winners instead of the usual selection of two Tout Bout winners in a month is a result of two errors — one by me in including with the February nominations a March video nominated by a colleague of the journalist and one by an editor who nominated a video in the wrong category.</p>
<p>After conferring with other top Digital First Media editors, we decided to recognize all three videos as Tout Bout winners, without categories. All three earned strong praise from the judges.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also going to suspend the Tout Bout contest at least for March, while editors consider whether to make changes in the awards and how to coordinate judging and announcements <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/looking-for-my-next-opportunity-whatever-that-is/" target="_blank">after my departure from the company</a>.</p>
<h3>Judges</h3>
<p>Judges for the February DFMies and Tout Bout were the January winners (including representatives from staff winners): Daniel Tedford, Daniel Aitken, Harrison Sheppard, Dana Bartholomew, John McCoy, Carolina Garcia, Miriam Vasquez, Tom Tripicco, Nathan Mayberg, Ben Garver, Dave Boucher, Matt Murphy, Marcus Costentino, Stephanie Metzger, Eric Bonzar, Sarah Kuta, Kevin Johnson, Zack Ponce, Karl Mondon, John Valenzuela, Jim Harrington, Chuck Barney, Julie Jag and Stephen Baxter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/2014dfmies-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="2014dfmies" /></p><p><a href="http://denverpost.com" target="_blank">The Denver Post</a> and <a href="http://ydr.com" target="_blank">York Daily Record</a> each won four 2014 DFMies for the best work of last year by Digital First Media staff members.</p>
<p>Three clusters where multiple newsrooms collaborate on news coverage had similar DFMie showings: five for the Los Angeles News Group, four for the Bay Area News Group and four for the Connecticut newsrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://registercitizen.com" target="_blank">The Register Citizen</a> in Torrington, Conn., and <a href="http://pottsmerc.com" target="_blank">The Mercury</a> in Pottstown, Pa., led a strong showing by DFM’s smaller newsrooms, each winning two DFMies.</p>
<p>In all, 36 journalists won DFMies in judging conducted March 7-8 in New York by a panel of journalists and journalism professors from outside the company. Four newsrooms won a total of six staff awards. The awards will be presented to the winners at an April 23 program at the St. Paul Hotel in St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p>Winners receive $1,000 each (split if up to four journalists were nominated). For staff winners (five or more people contributing), the $1,000 prize goes towards a staff party or a community donation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Jessica-Glenza-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Jessica Glenza" /></p><p><strong>Jessica Glenza</strong> won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">DFMie as Journalist of the Year in small-daily newsrooms</a> for her work as a reporter for the Register Citizen in Torrington, Conn.</p>
<p>As one of four Journalist of the Year winners, Glenza went into a second round of judging with new judges to select the Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. The winner of that award will be announced April 23 at the DFMies program in St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p>Glenza is now a <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/about/who-we-are" target="_blank">web producer at Thunderdome</a>. Her Connecticut editors’ nomination detailed her work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jessica Glenza’s tenure in Torrington was brief, but her impact was immense. Joining the staff near the beginning of 2013, her intensity was immediately felt as the quality of reporting rose in a beat that had been crucial to Torrington coverage for years. She covered a hybrid beat of crime and education because our staff is too small to have a separate reporter for each of those difficult beats.</p>
<p>Jessica immediately jumped in and broke stories that challenged officials and caused school board members to squirm under the scrutiny of true watchdog coverage.</p>
<p>The Torrington school district is more dysfunctional than most and was used to coverage from our competition, a daily paper from a nearby town with 10 times the circulation and a much larger staff, that rarely challenged what they said never asked probing questions.</p>
<p>Jessica is a natural reporter, always inquisitive, always pushing for more answers, always striving to tell the more complete story.</p>
<p>This was her first job working for a daily newspaper and she took to the constant deadlines like a seasoned veteran, producing breaking news for online, tweeting, doing write-thru versions, shooting photos, balancing multiple stories each day, all with an intense enjoyment of the job that came from her innate need to tell the stories that were not being told.</p>
<p>Soon after starting in Torrington, Jessica, with the help of co-managing editor Tom Cleary, uncovered the scandal surrounding the <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130320/victim-bullied-after-rape-allegations-against-torrington-football-players">bullying of rape victims at Torrington High School</a>. Her intrepid reporting broke a story that made national headlines and kept her a step or two ahead of coverage from CNN to the New York Times to the UK Daily Mail and countless other outlets that overran Torrington in the wake of that scandal.</p>
<p>That was the most high-profile example, but her reporting was just as solid on every story she produced in 2013. She broke stories about <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/social-affairs/20130824/connecticut-struggles-to-identify-homeless-students-torrington-count-rising">homeless youth</a>, <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130322/torrington-high-school-bullying-log-records-absent-district-compliance-inconsistent-2">problems with bullying reporting in area schools</a>, excessive amounts of money spent by the Board of Education on legal fees, an extensive profile of a <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130511/winsted-man-accused-of-killing-girlfriend-13-years-ago-still-awaits-trial-while-earning-129000-a-year-in-state-job">state employee collecting a 6-figure salary for more than 13 years while awaiting trial for killing his girlfriend</a>, and many <a href="http://www.registercitizen.com/general-news/20130913/mom-of-alleged-torrington-rape-victim-son-was-bullied-by-teammates-before-assault">more</a>.</p>
<p>All of this in a city that is notoriously tight-lipped about everything and mostly refuses to talk to media about any topic. Her persistence and investigative skills got around obstacles to produce stories that were compelling, informative, and great examples of both investigative and watchdog journalism.</p>
<p>Her intelligence, talent and intense work ethic earned her a position with DFM’s Thunderdome less than a year after starting at one of the company’s smaller daily papers.</p>
<p>Her coverage of the bullying and rape in Torrington has now been nominated for many national awards, including being submitted for consideration for a Pulitzer.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Glenza&#8217;s work earned mentions in <a href="http://jezebel.com/5991538/another-sexual-assault-victim-is-bullied-online-after-rape-allegations-against-connecticut-football-players">Jezebel</a> and <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/207965/newspaper-explains-decision-to-publish-students-tweets-about-sex-assault-case/">Poynter</a>.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Judges&#8217; comments:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Remarkable sourcing and persistence in gathering evidence in reporting some very sensitive stories. Incredible combination of methods using old and new media. Very nuanced portrayal of some potentially thorny topics. Dogged reporting to overcome administrative roadblocks in the school districts on the school districts she covered.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Register Citizen’s coverage of the rape/bullying story and related commentary also won the DFMie for public service. Those were two of four DFMies for the Connecticut newsrooms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/Rick-Mills2-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Rick Mills2" /></p><p><strong>Rick Mills</strong>, editor of the Morning Sun in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank">2014 Opinion Journalism DFMie</a> for his columns challenging court secrecy.</p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unusual secrecy surrounding a local murder prompted Rick Mills to investigate further and find that the Clare County District Court was ignoring court rules and state Supreme Court guidelines in keeping key documents &#8212; affidavits on the evidence leading to arrests &#8212; hidden. This case remains troubling. A year later, the defendant has still not faced trial, and the lead investigator just resigned from the Clare County Sheriff&#8217;s Department. Something remains amiss.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nomination included two links:</p>
<p><a title="Clare court ignores rules, keeps key murder file secret" href="http://www.themorningsun.com/article/20130412/OPINION03/130419890">Clare court ignores rules, keeps key murder file secret</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" title="Clare courts follow the rules, seal documents" href="http://www.themorningsun.com/article/20130420/OPINION03/130429955">Clare courts follow the rules, seal documents</a></span></p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rick Mills is the best kind of columnist: not only an opinion writer, but a reporter. His detailed account of his efforts to obtain an affidavit in a murder case &#8212; a document that should have been public &#8212; takes the reader along as he faces one arrogant and incompetent authority after the other. In the end, he teaches some of these officials the fundamentals of the law, and shows the reader how basic civil rights can hang on the whim of a supposed public servant.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[Karen Workman of Thunderdome's breaking news team won the 2014 SEO Headline Writing DFMie.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/kworkman-mug-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Karen Workman" /></p><p><strong>Karen Workman</strong> of Thunderdome won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 SEO Headline Writing DFMie.</a></p>
<p>The nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Karen Workman has emerged as a leader of Thunderdome’s efforts to publish the best possible headlines, even hosting standup meetings to enlighten and encourage her colleagues. And as deputy editor of the breaking news desk, she is able to lead by example every day.</p>
<p>Workman is a wizard at chopping headlines down to their most SEO-friendly elements, using the right phrases to maximize their effectiveness. She knows what works and will write several draft headlines, if time permits, to get the right wording. In short, she is a leader in headline-writing techniques, as the accompanying links show.</p></blockquote>
<p>These were the headlines and results submitted with her nomination:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Lupe Fiasco ushered offstage at inaugural event after anti-Obama rap</span></p>
<p>More than 22,000 page views in the early days of Thunderdome (Jan. 21, 2013)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Video of Miley Cyrus&#8217; shocking VMA performance</span></p>
<p>More than 21,000 page views. (Aug. 26, 2013)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Video: Jennifer Lawrence falls on way to accept best actress award at Oscars</span></p>

<p>Pageviews: 10,006 (Jul 12, 2013)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Watch video of Sunny, the new dog at the White House</span></p>
<p>Pageviews: 8,668 (Aug. 20, 2013)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Samsung&#8217;s Super Bowl ad making fun of copyright issues goes viral</span></p>
<p>Pageviews; 6,126 (Feb. 1, 2013)</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments</p>
<blockquote><p>Karen Workman is able to carefully walk the line between headlines that are SEO-friendly and headlines that are human-friendly. She uses excellent keywords, but then also uses less-than-usual but effective words that both save more space for SEO keywords AND convey more tone and content to a human reader who finds the headline with or without a search, encouraging the click. &#8220;NASCAR&#8217;s Jeff Gordon pranks unsuspecting car salesman in Pepsi video,&#8221; for example, uses &#8220;pranks&#8221; as a linchpin verb without any loss of SEO effectiveness. &#8220;Video of Miley Cyrus&#8217; shocking VMA performance&#8221; doesn&#8217;t need a verb with &#8220;shocking&#8221; in it. These headlines are both conversational AND effective, a quality that has become rare.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Jim Steinberg</strong>, <strong>Rachel Luna</strong> and <strong>Paul W. Penzella</strong> won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">2014 Special DFMie for Watchdog Journalism</a> for their project on continued contamination of drinking water in Hinkley, Calif.</p>
<p>The San Bernardino Sun project, <a title="Hinkley: a ghost town in the making" href="http://www.sbsun.com/hinkley">Hinkley: A ghost town in the making</a>, did not initially win any of the 30 2014 DFMie categories in judging March 7-8 in New York. But it was a finalist in three categories: investigative/enterprise, specialized news coverage and public service. As judges wrapped up their considerations in the final two categories, both of which the Hinkley project nearly won, they insisted that the Sun&#8217;s work should win something.</p>
<p>The judges recommended that Digital First Media award the project a special DFMie. Editor-in-Chief Jim Brady agreed to award the trio a Special DFMie for Watchdog Journalism.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the nomination for public service:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the movie, justice prevailed.</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, the residents of a small unincorporated town in the rural high desert of Southern California took on energy giant PG&amp;E. And they won.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E did poison their groundwater, and families suffered grievously. A judge ordered PG&amp;E to pay one of the largest financial penalties ever levied in a civil lawsuit. An arrogant corporation was forced to take responsibility, and the residents of Hinkley resumed their lives, triumphant in a way that makes for great cinema. Indeed, the case was made famous in the 2000 film &#8220;Erin Brockovich.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of Hinkley did not live happily ever after.</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, the toxic plume of groundwater under the remote community grew larger, not smaller, and the town itself continued to suffer. Despite ground-breaking remediation techniques and the arguable mitigation of the environmental danger, Hinkley is dying. Property values have plummeted, and the ability to earn a living is practically non-existent. Last spring, the town’s only school closed.</p>
<p>Brockovich herself has a difficult time comprehending what has happened in the years since she played a pivotal role in making PG&amp;E accountable to the people of Hinkley. “I walked away assuming that everything was OK,” she said. “I feel duped, ashamed and really sad for the people of Hinkley.”</p>
<p>In what we believe to be the most comprehensive, lucid reporting ever produced on Hinkley, the environmental disaster and its aftermath, reporter Jim Steinberg spent six months interviewing residents, experts, government officials and utility representatives to understand how Hinkley has come to such a bad end. Along the way he exhaustively sifted through thousands of pages of documents.</p>
<p>In dozens of images and videos, photojournalist Rachel Luna captured the despair and desolation that has come to characterize the community. Visual journalist Paul Penzella independently researched, reported and produced digital and print interactives and maps that illustrated publicly for the first time the scope of both the growth of the plume as well as PG&amp;E’s management tactics, which include the purchase of acres and acres of land in and around Hinkley.</p>
<p>Ultimately,The Sun published a penetrating package of stories, photographs and information graphics explaining not just what happened, but a deeper look at the science behind the attempted clean-up, the dangers of chromium-6, the depth of the community’s pain and, most importantly, the individual stories of residents.</p>
<p>The work was widely praised. Even PG&amp;E said it was the most thorough and balanced reporting it had seen done on the topic.</p>
<p>For their work bringing to light the ongoing tragedy of one of California’s most infamous environmental disasters, The Sun is proud to nominate Steinberg, Luna and Penzella for the DFMie in Public Service.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Judges&#8217; comments:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">A multimillion-dollar lawsuit and big-budget film “Erin Brockovich” in 2000 brought national attention to the plight of residents in the heavily polluted small town of Hinkley, Calif. Most assumed justice had been served. The San Bernardino Sun reminds us all that real Hollywood endings are rare, and that the problems of Hinkley residents are far from over. Beautifully written and photographed, this project is a sterling example of watchdog journalism at its very best.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">This is one of five DFMies for the Los Angeles News Group.</span></p>

<p><a title="Rachel Luna" href="https://twitter.com/Rache1Luna">Luna</a> has been a multimedia journalist with the San Bernardino Sun for two years. She originally joined DFM in 2010 as a freelance photographer at the San Gabriel Valley Tribune and soon joined the staff as a weeklies reporter. She worked there for a year before moving east to cover the Inland Empire.</p>
<p>She graduated from Azusa Pacific University in 2010 with a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Liberal Studies. It was there, while working as a photo editor for the university&#8217;s newspaper, that she discovered a love for photojournalism.</p>
<p>Her most compelling and challenging assignment was visually reporting the tragic story of Hinkley. &#8220;Ironically, I was watching the movie &#8216;Erin Brockovich&#8217; a few days before I was asked to take on the project with reporter Jim Steinberg,&#8221; Luna said. &#8220;With the movie fresh in my mind, it was disturbing to learn that nearly 20 years later Hinkley residents were still being poisoned by a growing contaminated groundwater plume. ..<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">. It was hard to watch as pollution overpowered the residents of Hinkley, but I was committed to visually unveiling the grim reality of what happened to the small desert town and its residents through photos and videos.&#8221;</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Daily Camera's Charlie Brennan won the Investigative/Enterprise DFMie for small newsrooms for reporting on the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2014/03/CHARLIE+BRENNAN-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Charlie Brennan" /></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Charlie Brennan</strong> of the Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners" target="_blank">Investigative/Enterprise DFMie for small newsrooms</a> for breaking a story that had stayed a secret for more than decade.</span></p>
<p>On Jan. 27, 2013, Brennan reported that the <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_22446410">grand jury investigating the death of JonBenet Ramsey had voted to indict her parents in 1999</a>, but the district attorney refused to prosecute.</p>
<p>Brennan’s editors’ nomination explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It had been years since we’d seen a true bombshell in Boulder’s most notorious criminal case, but this absolutely qualified as one – all thanks to the dogged investigative reporting of Charlie Brennan, who has covered the Ramsey case since Day 1.</p>
<p>Through sources that included grand jurors, Charlie was able to confirm, for the first time, that the grand jury that investigated the unsolved slaying of 6-year-old JonBenet in 1998 and 1999 secretly voted to indict the girl’s parents, on charges of child abuse resulting in death, and that the district attorney refused to prosecute them.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the end of the story.</p>
<p>Following his revelation, Charlie enlisted the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to help pursue the release of the indictment, first through open-records requests, then a lawsuit against the current DA.</p>
<p>Much to many observers’ surprise, a judge in October ordered the <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_24381455">release of the unprosecuted indictment</a>, which confirmed what we’d reported months earlier.</p>
<p>(The story on the indictment’s release was written by Mitchell Byars, since Brennan was a plaintiff – and Brennan wrote an <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_24384386">essay about why he sued for release of the indictment</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Other stories submitted as part of Brennan’s nomination:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_22446411">Legal expert: Ramsey grand jury&#8217;s vote on abuse charge possibly a &#8216;compromise&#8217;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_22446420">JonBenet Ramsey&#8217;s death a tragic, bizarre case from the start</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Charlie Brennan&#8217;s investigation into the JonBenet Ramsey case is an incredible example of the power of &#8216;staying on a story.&#8217; By developing his sources and fighting to publicly release legal documents, Brennan did an exceptional job of keeping our legal system transparent and accountable.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of two DFMies for the Camera and six for the Colorado newsrooms. The Camera and the Denver Post swept both the large-newsroom and small-newsroom DFMies for breaking news and investigative/enterprise journalism.</p>

<h3>Other finalists</h3>
<p>Other small-newsroom finalists for the Investigative or Enterprise Journalism DFMie were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Michael Price</strong> and <strong>Kristina Scala</strong> of the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa., for their <a href="file://localhost/1.%09http/::www.dailylocal.com:social-affairs:20130923:casd-in-crisis-after-racially-charged-text-messages-surface">reporting on racist text messages by local school officials</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>The investigative or enterprise category was not divided by newsroom size in 2013, when <a title="Pioneer Press examination of public pension ‘spiking’ wins investigative journalism DFMie" href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/pioneer-press-examination-public-pension-spiking-wins-investigative-journalism-dfmie/">MaryJo Webster, Mara Gottfried, Christopher Magan and C.J.

<p>Multimedia journalist <strong>Jason Plotkin</strong> of the York Daily Record won the <a href="http://outsidethunderdome.com/2014/03/26/2014-dfmie-winners/" target="_blank">2014 Journalist of the Year DFMie</a> for mid-sized newsrooms.</p>
<p>The editors&#8217; nomination detailed his outstanding year.<b> </b><b> </b></p>
<blockquote><p>For his community leadership, passion for people, personal drive for truth and gift for storytelling, please consider Jason Plotkin for Journalist of the Year.</p>
<p>A multimedia journalist, Jason seeks out stories, brings them forth and makes them awesome. He shoots photos, produces video, makes documentaries. He Touts, tweets, blogs. He reports and writes. He never coasts. He earned three monthly DFMies this year.</p>
<p>He’s the guy for spot news photos and cute kid pictures. He’s the guy for high school sports and conversation-changing enterprise. And he’s the guy to bring our community together. Among his exceptional 2013 efforts:</p></blockquote>

Jason’s documentary tracks the highs and lows of Miller’s journey toward robotic hands, and how faith played a role in his outlook.</span></li>

One victim — then age 5 but now 18 — came forward from a community that had swept away the incident. With patience and empathy, Jason and a reporter drew out her memories over many months. Jason’s photojournalism was compelling, but his interviewing work is what helped bring this story to a community that could draw strength from how one of its own blossomed after a tragedy.</span></li>

He produced captivating photo galleries and video stories full of action and fun. But his video of a transgender re-enactor told a serious story with an appropriate tone.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;"><a title="Burger King funeral" href="http://www.ydr.com/ci_22457374/west-york-mans-mourners-pay-him-final-tribute">Burger King funeral</a>:</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> Jason’s image of a woman placing a Whopper on her father’s casket — because the man loved fast food — resonated nationally. The image was published in major magazines, on CNN and NBC News, and earned Jason national AP photo of the month honors.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;"><a title="Touting pumpkins" href="http://www.tout.com/m/l8gtmq">Touting pumpkins</a>: </b><span style="font-style: italic;">Jason jumps on new technology. When a new social video sharing app called Tout came down from DFM, and when someone stole a local boy’s giant pumpkin — and later returned it with an apology — Jason found a creatively simple and fun way to tell the story.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;">Immediacy and engagement:</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> Jason championed a workflow using a DSLR camera and digital tablet to immediately tweet photos from the sidelines of major sporting events. The workflow has since become standard for our photographers at news scenes. He also leads seminars with local firefighters to teach the benefits of sharing news and images via Twitter, keeping their communities informed.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;">Sparking discussion: </b><span style="font-style: italic;">Jason blogs about his experiences in the field, and they usually result in great journalism debates. One post, about his encounter with a homeless woman on a sub-zero-degree morning, sparked industry conversation about the responsibilities of journalists as good citizens.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-style: italic;">DART Center for Journalism and Trauma taskforce:</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> After a project about the lasting effects of a school shooting earned an honorable mention in the Dart Center’s national awards for trauma and journalism, Jason participated in a Dart panel discussion on how the project came together. He and a colleague are now working with company executives to create the groundbreaking DFM Trauma Awareness and Peer Support Program.</span></li>

<p>In addition to winning Journalist of the Year, Plotkin was a finalist in two other categories: He and Brandie Kessler were finalists in feature/lifestyle/entertainment journalism for the story of the transgender re-enactor and his video about Paul Miller was a finalist in the long-video category.</p>
<p>Judges&#8217; comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jason Plotkin has a wonderful visual range, and a voice that can translate into different media and still match his subject. He seems to see his assignments with a sideways cock to his head: &#8220;How can I make this different? Is this better as a video? What angles would be unusual?&#8221; To say his visuals complement text would be an understatement: They do not overwhelm the text, but somehow allow the text to shine brighter. Though his medium is visual, his impact is far deeper, which makes him an excellent journalist, and journalist of the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plotkin was also a finalist in feature/entertainment/journalism and long video. Judges weren&#8217;t asked to provide comments about the finalists, but a long-video finalist volunteered this comment about Plotkin&#8217;s video:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;d like to give special recognition to Jason Plotkin of the York Daily Record for his video about Paul Miller. Plotkin did a nice job of being at the right place at the right time to capture the emotional moments of Miller&#8217;s journey that helped tell his story. It was great that he was able to spend a lot of time with Miller so we could see his story unfold.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of four DFMies for the York Daily Record and one of seven for Pennsylvania newsrooms.</p>
<p>As one of four Journalist of the Year winners, Plotkin went into a second round of judging with new judges to select the Digital First Media Journalist of the Year. The winner of that award will be announced April 23 at the DFMies program in St. Paul, Minn.</p>
