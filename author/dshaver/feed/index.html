		<description><![CDATA[Within the Digital First Media family, Thunderdome is a bit of an anomaly.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/05/photo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Visiting local newspapers is an important part of Thunderdome user research. Here is the York Daily Record&#039;s offset printing press, located at its York, PA newsroom complex where Thunderdome technology producer Davis Shaver visited last week. (Thunderdome file photo)" /></p><p>Within the Digital First Media family, Thunderdome is a bit of an anomaly.</p>
<p>We’re not a local newsroom and don’t publish a print edition. We don’t even have a web presence of our own. But what we share with DFM’s local papers is a commitment to great journalism and a promise that we’re in this together. Thunderdome provides more than just content for DFM papers. We also function as as their backup, an editorial support service sharing training, guidance and tools with newsrooms across the country.</p>
<p>Many of us at Thunderdome used to work in publications very similar to the ones we serve. Yet we still find it important to constantly remind ourselves of their needs and pain-points. That’s why, last week, I paid a visit to the <a href="http://www.ydr.com/">York Daily Record</a>, a Digital First Media newspaper not far from my hometown of Lebanon, PA (where I began my career as a freelancer with another DFM outlet, the <a href="http://www.ldnews.com/">Lebanon Daily News</a>).</p>
<p>I was there to gather feedback on the upcoming release of a new Thunderdome content management system, which we’re calling Mission Control. The site, built on WordPress, will be a space for Thunderdome to publish content and assist with editorial planning and collaboration across the entire DFM footprint. The primary end-users will be reporters, producers and editors in local newsrooms. We’ve made it a priority to engage them for feedback throughout the product development process.</p>
<p>Talking to the group at York reminded me of an important fact: Local news is not easy. It can be demoralizing to read constant doom-and-gloom press about an industry in peril, difficult to feel like you’re fighting with technology instead of benefitting from it. Too often it seems that the systems we use were built by people with little knowledge of how news organizations actually operate. That’s the legacy Thunderdome seeks to overcome.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the great feedback and ideas we’ve received, we are very excited to launch Mission Control and will provide updates here in the coming weeks. For now, though… back to work!</p>

		<title>Five ways you can use DocumentCloud for journalism</title>

		<description><![CDATA[We put together a list of five ways DocumentCloud can be used to support journalism in a local newsroom.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/doc-cloud-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="doc-cloud" /></p><p>In <a href="http://live.outsidethunderdome.com/Event/Live_Chat_Ted_Han_and_Jaimi_Dowell">our recent live chat with Ted Han and Jaimi Dowdell</a>, data editor Tom Meagher and I learned a bunch we didn&#8217;t know about <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/home">DocumentCloud</a>, a web app that makes it easy for journalists to analyze, annotate and publish documents.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of it as a competitor to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>, stop now – I made the same mistake. DocumentCloud differs in a few fundamental ways, in large part because it caters specifically to journalists, thanks to stewardship by <a href="http://www.ire.org/">Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors</a> and early funding by the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a>. Intended from <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/encyclo/documentcloud/">inception</a> to serve journalists, DocumentCloud has a number of &#8220;killer&#8221; features for reporters and editors dealing with document collections.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we put together a list of five ways DocumentCloud can be used to support journalism in a local newsroom. Find those below.</p>
<p>We also recommend checking out <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/686468-using-documentcloud.html">this guide to using DocumentCloud</a> – it&#8217;s a great resource that had Jaimi made for <a href="http://live.outsidethunderdome.com/Event/Live_Chat_Ted_Han_and_Jaimi_Dowell">our chat</a>! And if you have other tips to share, leave them in the comments.</p>
<h3>Five Ways DocumentCloud Can Support Journalism</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintain private notes on a document. </strong>In a newsroom years ago, you might be able to tell how info-dense a document was by the number of Post-It Notes attached. DocumentCloud lets you do the same thing, without the risk of paper cuts. Private notes can be attached to any section of a document, where they also get organized on a dedicated &#8216;Notes&#8217; tab.</li>
<li><strong><span><span style="line-height: 14px">Collaborate on annotations and publish them with the document.</span></span></strong><span><span style="line-height: 14px"> Not all notes are meant to be private. One of the neatest uses of DocumentCloud I&#8217;ve seen is the &#8216;Show Sources&#8217; feature ProPublica built to integrate annotations into story presentation – <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/why-cant-linda-carswell-get-her-husbands-heart-back">great example here</a>. Think of it as showing your work.</span></span></li>
<li><strong>Extract structured data using OpenCalais. </strong>DocumentCloud processes documents with <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">OpenCalais</a>, a Thomson Reuters service that discovers &#8220;entities&#8221; (people, places, organizations, terms, etc) mentioned in text. You can even add custom key/value pairs to a document and then search against those. And of course, both these features are accessible through the API, making it easy to tap this incredible toolset with nothing more than a simple GET request.</li>
<li><strong>Generate a timeline from dates in a document. </strong>Did I lose you at &#8216;API&#8217;? Don&#8217;t worry! There&#8217;s an even easier way to use structured data extracted by OpenCalais. DocumentCloud automatically generates a timeline based on dates found in your document.</li>
<li><strong>Manage a large collection of </strong><strong>documents. </strong>DocumentCloud is great for analyzing a single document, but it&#8217;s especially handy when you want to examine a large collection of documents (like 24,000 pages of <a title="NY Times' Palin emails" href="http://projects.nytimes.com/palin-emails/date/2006-12-04" target="_blank">Sarah Palin&#8217;s emails</a>, for instance). DocumentCloud makes it easy to embed a collection, create a timeline, or extract entities from a set of documents. Combined with the product’s collaborative functionality, the result is a tool that is very helpful for newsrooms tackling major reporting projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;d like access to the tool, which is available only to journalists, <a href="mailto:info@documentcloud.org?subject=joining">email DocumentCloud</a> and ask your editor to do the same. All they require is permission to include participating newsrooms on <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/contributors">their list of document contributors</a>.</p>
<p>Have questions? Leave them in the comments and Tom or I will get back to you ASAP!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/post-celebration-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Denver Post Reporter Jordan Steffan and Assistant Managing Editor Tim Rasmussen celebrate after learning that the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Coverage for their efforts in the hours and days following the Aurora Theater Shooting. The Denver Post also had two other finalists in various categories. (Joe Amon/The Denver Post)" /></p><p>On Monday, the Denver Post was awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for its coverage of the July 20, 2012, shooting at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colo.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize Board issued the following citation with the prize:</p>
<blockquote><p>Awarded to The Denver Post Staff for its comprehensive coverage of the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., that killed 12 and injured 58, using journalistic tools, from Twitter and Facebook to video and written reports, both to capture a breaking story and provide context.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Breaking-News-Reporting">entry documents</a> submitted by the newsroom show how a modern news organization can utilize <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews02.pdf">social media</a>, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews04.pdf">video</a>, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews03.pdf">photography</a>, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews07.pdf">interactive media</a> and, most importantly, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/breaking-news-reporting/aurorabreakingnews01.pdf">solid reporting</a> to cover breaking news in realtime (note: links are to PDFs).</p>
<p>“We all wish July 20 never happened, but it did, and I could not be more proud of The Denver Post for its exhaustive and creative coverage,” said Post editor Gregory L. Moore in <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23029438/denver-post-staff-wins-pulitzer-prize-aurora-theater">an article published by the paper</a>. “It is a great achievement to have that work honored with a Pulitzer Prize.”</p>
<p>This was the Post’s fourth Pulitzer Prize in as many years, a winning streak matched only by the New York Times.</p>
<p>“Winning a Pulitzer Prize four years in a row is beyond impressive, it’s awe-inspiring,” said Jim Brady, editor-in-chief of Digital First Media. “This speaks to the incredible commitment to high-quality journalism that has driven the Post newsroom for so many years, but also to its ability to deliver on that commitment across so many platforms. The Aurora tragedy was one that required use of all those platforms, and the Post delivered on all of them, and that is because of the world-class newsroom that Greg Moore has built.”</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Denver Post and <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/node/8501">all other winners</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/san-bernardino-sun-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Pam Langford, left, and Kathryn Ervin, right, view a bound copy of a 1939 edition of The San Bernardino Daily Sun at California State University San Bernardino April 8, 2013. (Gabriel Luis Acosta/San Bernardino Sun)" /></p><p>Whether it’s <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/03/04/20-digital-first-newspapers-have-community-media-labs/">community newsrooms</a> or <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/04/05/dfm-workshop-teaches-practical-engagement-techniques/">community engagement</a>, Digital First Media newspapers have long made it a priority to deepen bonds with the communities they serve. The San Bernardino County Sun, for example, which has been continually serving its residents for 119 years, recently donated the entirety of its archive to the San Bernardino County Historical Archives and Cal State San Bernardino’s John M. Pfau Library.</p>
<p>As LANG Vice President and Executive Editor Michael Anasatasi puts it, the history and heritage of papers like the San Bernardino Sun are tantamount to the history and heritage of the communities they serve. The daily newspaper has undergone several names changes since its first edition, from the Daily Sun to the Sun Telegram and finally, to the San Bernardino County Sun.</p>
<p>“This puts 120 years of San Bernardino county history into the hands of its citizens,” Anastasi said. “There’s no better living source of history than what we see in a newspaper. Not only do you see the newspaper articles of the day, but you see the editorials and the advertisements. It’s a window into our community’s past.”</p>
<p>The gift has made it possible to shift archival preservation duties from The Sun to organizations with the expertise and resources needed to protect delicate newspaper archives. Placing the volumes in the care of professional archivists also improves access for historians seeking to write about San Bernardino or greater Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The San Bernardino County Historical Archives have also agreed to digitize all editions of the newspaper from 1894 to 1999, providing access on the newspaper&#8217;s website after the digitization has been completed.</p>
<p>The transfer was made official at a Memorandum of Understanding signing event at the Pfau Library April 8, 2013. We&#8217;ve included text of Anastasi&#8217;s speech below – the original was placed in the archives, alongside the newspapers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Text of LANG Vice President and Executive Editor Michael Anasatasi&#8217;s Speech at Memorandum of Understanding Event</h3>
<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>Alas, San Bernardino! Whyfore art thou bankrupt?</p>
<p>Thank god for The Sun, which also rises, and which has for nearly 120 years ensured the people of the largest county in the lower 48 have been, as our forefathers demanded upon our founding, a well­informed citizenry.</p>
<p>Today, we commemorate that long­running and illustrious chronicle of this great county&#8217;s storied past, as we donate The Sun&#8217;s archive to the county and Cal State San Bernardino.</p>
<p>I am here to talk about the past, but I also want to talk about the future, your future, and the future of the Sun. Thank you for inviting me here today and providing me with the honor of speaking.</p>
<p>I have been associated with many wonderful newsrooms over my 28 years in the profession, with staffs that have won many journalism awards. I won’t bore you with the details, as I surely have my wife, a librarian who finally took notice when I told her I was speaking to a group that included a number of accomplished librarians.</p>
<p>Among librarians and journalists, there are no two groups of professionals who cherish the First Amendment more. That is why today is so important. I know these archives will be in safe hands for decades to come.</p>
<p>At The Sun, we&#8217;re very proud of our history and heritage, which really is your history and heritage, and we count ourselves fortunate to have been the chroniclers of it since we published our first issue, those many years ago, on Sept. 1, 1894.</p>
<p>Our lead story that day, incidentally, was headlined &#8220;BUSINESS REVIVING,&#8221; which would be a welcome headline in tomorrow&#8217;s edition, no?</p>
<p>Of course, there was another story at the top of the same page in about the same type size, that said, &#8220;WINE MEN DISAGREE,&#8221; apparently about a flap between some local vintners.</p>
<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>
<p>By the time that first edition of the Sun was published, the post­-Civil War economic boom that hit Southern California was already beginning to wane. Of the more than 30 recognized towns that sprang up seemingly overnight in the county, fewer than half survived, including Ontario, Redlands, Rialto, Colton, Chino, Barstow and Needles. Hard times are nothing new to those who have lived here, and neither is rebuilding.</p>
<p>The family of my own ancestor, Francisco Lugo, recognized as one of the founders of the city of Los Angeles, was instrumental in the establishment, development and growth of Redlands, a ￼legacy of which I remain proud.</p>
<p>After the Spanish­-American war, the San Bernardino Valley saw a rebirth with the blooming of citrus fruit, a thriving dairy industry and famous health resorts for the wealthy.</p>
<p>Oranges grown in the county became an annual Christmas staple in the stockings of children throughout America. They tasted them, and they dreamed of a California city named San Bernardino. Later, many of them moved here.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, the Sun was the county’s largest locally-­owned employer. The newspaper had established itself as an advocate of reform. As one historian later wrote, “Open gambling was driven out under indictment of the editor’s pen.” I hope that editor is able to rest at ease despite gambling’s very organized and state­-sanctioned return. &#8230; Anyone have numbers in the Powerball?</p>
<p>That mission of reform, of listening to those we serve, of advocacy for the voiceless, remains one of the most important things we do. Just last month, the Sun opened a news lounge with the express intent of reconnecting, in a highly personal way, with our readers. We welcome you to visit, we welcome you to participate in the regular community events we will be holding there. We are nothing without you, and we know that.</p>
<p>The Sun moved downtown in 1949 and, except for a few adventurous years in the suburbs where we relocated next to perhaps the only Lowe&#8217;s in America that has ever shuttered its doors, it&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve always been. Downtown is where we reside today. We’ve come home.</p>
<p>During the 1950s, the Sun had opened bureaus in Ontario, Fontana, Redlands, Loma Linda, Yucaipa, Twentynine Palms, Victorville, Barstow, Ridgecrest, Needles and Bloomington. The paper was so successful it was bought by the Times­-Mirror Corporation, then Gannett, then, in 1999, MediaNews Group, which today is operated by Digital First Media.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, Digital First.</p>
<p>Nearly everything about our profession has changed as we are living through a transformative era in communications. Not since the advent of the printing press have we’ve seen such changes in how technology is impacting our lives, and the dissemination of information, as we are now. In business terms, it’s called a “disruption.”</p>
<p>The fact is, every day more and more people are consuming their news through digital means. In fact, more people read the Sun today, combining the traditional print form and the various digital tools through which it’s delivered, than ever have before. Yet the business of digital is very different, and as society evolves, we find ourselves challenged to sustain our news organization. The days of ubiquitous bureaus are gone.</p>
<p>But what has not changed is our commitment to this city, to this county, to this community. Every day we come to work determined to report the news as we always have, to invent and innovate, to put forth our product in the way each individual consumer prefers, to ensure that, as was called for that first day, the citizenry remains well­informed.</p>
<p>We are grateful to you for sticking with us during this journey.</p>
<p>Earlier I spoke of wine, and there is wine here tonight. Please join me in raising a glass to the long history of The Sun and this delightful partnership between your favorite local newspaper, county government and our local center for higher learning.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/04/post-art-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="post-art" /></p><div id="attachment_2479" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2479" alt="Dave Winer will join us for a Thunderdome live chat at 2:00 pm ET on April 10." src="/content/uploads/2013/04/dave-winer-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dave Winer will join us for a Thunderdome live chat at 2:00 pm ET on April 10.</p></div>
<p>On next week&#8217;s Thunderdome live chat, we&#8217;ll be talking with Dave Winer, a true pioneer of the web. His blog, <a href="http://scriptingnews.com">scriptingnews.com</a>, is said to be the oldest online, and through his work with RSS, XML-RPC, and content management systems, he has left a technological legacy that continues to undergird much of the Internet today. Dave has also been a commentator on the news industry for a good portion of his career, such as through his podcast collaboration with Jay Rosen on <a href="http://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">Rebooting the News</a> and writing like <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/01/dave-winer-how-can-universities-educate-journo-programmers/">this Nieman Lab post on the need for journo-programmers</a>.</p>
<p>Dave&#8217;s latest project is <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner</a>. Announced and released <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/myNewCompanyAndOurFirstProduct">last month</a>, it&#8217;s the first product of his new company, <a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture, Inc</a>. As the video embedded below shows, the app does just what the name implies – it lets users quickly build outlines of ideas by way of a lightweight, HTML 5-based tool.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='625' height='382' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/vE-2QeeiYxQ?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>What you see now though is just &#8220;the appetizer,&#8221; as Winer puts it. Small Picture will use Little Outliner&#8217;s technology (<a href="http://smallpicture.com/littleOutlinerPressGuide.html">background here</a>) as the core of more sophisticated outlining products that will allow networks of outlines to be built with <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">OPML</a> and served on any device, in any context, with whatever connectivity is available. It&#8217;s the type of product whose value proposition isn&#8217;t tied up in advertising or marketing opportunities, but rather in its ability to improve the lives of users&#8230; It&#8217;s the type of product Winer knows best, and the type of product he thinks newspapers should be creating for their readers.</p>
<p>Dave and I will be chatting about all this and more in our conversation next week. If there are topics you think we should address, leave them in the comments and we&#8217;ll be sure to include them. And remember, if you missed our earlier live chats, you can always find the archives at <a href="http://live.outsidethunderdome.com">live.outsidethunderdome.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://live.outsidethunderdome.com/Event/Live_Chat_Dave_Winer">Join us for a live chat with Dave Winer at 2:00pm ET on Wednesday April 10.</a></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/PSN-LOUNGE-07-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Frank Girardot, Pasadena Star-News Editor at Los Angeles Newspaper Group with his chopsticks and a plate of sushi at the grand opening of Star-News Lounge Tuesday, March 13, 2013. (SGVN/Photo by Walt Mancini/SXCity)" /></p><p>Just a few weeks ago we published <a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/2013/03/04/20-digital-first-newspapers-have-community-media-labs/">our map of Digital First Media community newsrooms</a>. Already, we&#8217;re back with an update.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Los Angeles News Group opened &#8216;news lounges&#8217; at two of its papers, the <a href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/">Pasadena Star-News</a> and <a href="http://www.sbsun.com/">San Bernardino Sun</a>. DFM Digital Transformations Editor Steve Buttry was there to <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/san-bernardino-sun-opens-news-lounge/">capture the moment</a>.</p>
<p>We spoke to LANG Vice President and Executive Editor Michael Anastasi about the openings, which both saw sizable community turnout:</p>
<blockquote><p>What struck me at both was how critical a role our news organizations play as facilitators of community discussion. And of course there&#8217;s nothing new about that, we&#8217;ve always been a hub for community engagement, but it was so gratifying to have so many community leaders say that to us in person. The community needs us, and it is our responsibility to serve them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anastasi also tells us that plans are in the works for LANG&#8217;s next community newsroom at the <a href="http://www.whittierdailynews.com/">Whittier Daily News</a> in Whittier, Cali.</p>
<p>Mariel Garza, LANG opinion editor and head of community engagement, has already begun developing programming for the venues, like community discussions and workshops. You can tweet your ideas to her at <a href="https://twitter.com/marielgarzaLANG">@MarielGarzaLANG</a>.</p>
<p>There are more pictures from the opening of the Pasadena facility by Steve and other LANG staff below, but first here&#8217;s a video of Mr. Twitter himself chatting with Frank Scandale, Digital First Media vice president of print production, about the new facility.</p>

Clay is a NYU professor and Internet theorist. (Photo credit: RSLN)" /></p><p>The Thunderdome newsroom is buzzing with excitement for tomorrow&#8217;s live chat with special guest Clay Shirky, who has also agreed to let us stream the discussion on live video. The conversation will be <a href="http://live.outsidethunderdome.com/Event/Live_Chat_Clay_Shirky">streamed on our chat hub</a>, with video production by Thunderdome video editor Yvonne Leow and producer Mimi Schiffman.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be chatting with Clay about the topics that have thus far defined his career – the power of crowds, the democratization of media, the impact of amateurism – but we want your participation, too. <a href="mailto:livechats@digitalfirstmedia.com">Email questions or comments</a> by 2:00pm EST tomorrow, and we&#8217;ll make sure they get asked on the air.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://live.outsidethunderdome.com/Event/Live_Chat_Clay_Shirky">The chat kicks off Wednesday (2/20) at 2:00pm. Join us here.</a></strong></p>
