<p>Last week, about 20 Digital First engagement editors from Pennsylvania newspapers gathered in West Chester, Penn., for a skills workshop that featured sessions on cutting edge interactive tools and techniques for journalists. Presentations by <a href="https://twitter.com/stevebuttry">Steve Buttry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Buffyandrews">Buffy Andrews</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vincecarey">Vince Carey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mjenkins">Mandy Jenkins</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ivanlajara">Ivan Lajara</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/diane5hoffman">Diane Hoffman</a> covered current and rising techniques for the editors to bring back to their newsrooms. The workshop also was broadcast live on UStream.</p>
<p>Buttry said the goal was to present quick, easily-digestible sessions to give editors an idea of some of the different techniques they could be using.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can dive in and do real detailed how-to tutorials on a few things, but if somebody already knows that tool, it&#8217;s not going to be helpful for them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Or, we can do a quick taste, cover a lot of ground and start the conversation on a lot of subjects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the topics covered included:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to get community members organized and interested in blogging.</li>
<li>The best way to share photos with readers, whether it&#8217;s on Facebook or in the print edition.</li>
<li>Broadcasting live from the newsroom.</li>
<li>Marketing your newsroom&#8217;s content so it&#8217;s seen by a wider audience.</li>
<li>Newer digital tools such as Geofeedia and New Hive.</li>
<li>Getting journalists and reporters excited about engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the workshop participants and teachers took to Twitter to discuss what they learned. Here are some of their reactions.</p>
<p>[<a href="//storify.com/phogan/digital-first-engagement-workshop-in-west-chester" target="_blank">View the story "Digital First engagement workshop in West Chester" on Storify</a>]Plans currently are in the works to bring similar engagement workshops to other Digital First Media clusters, according to Buttry.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/03/20130314-194716-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Visitors check out iPads in the NewsMoJo. The van is also outfitted with  laptops, smartphones, and a Slingbox-connected television. (Photo: Steve Buttry)" /></p><p>Many Digital First newsrooms are already inviting the public into their offices with community media labs, but several newspapers in the company are taking it a step further and hitting the road.</p>
<p>The Bay Area News Group joined the <a href="http://www.twincities.com/tcrover">Pioneer Press</a> and <a href="http://www.ydr.com/opinion/ci_20602990/mobile-media-lab-accelerate-countys-online-evolution">York Daily Record</a> last week when it launched the &#8220;<a href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/bay-area-news-groups-mobile-journalism-lab-drive-audience-engagement/">News MoJo</a>&#8221; – its new mobile journalism lab. The lab is a conversion van with working office space in its cabin for up to six people.</p>
<p>The idea came about during discussions of the Bay Area News Group community committee on how to engage more of its readers. Senior Engagement Editor Martin Reynolds said although the group maintains open community media news labs at its Oakland and San Jose offices, those are not accessible to large parts of its readership.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt we needed to do something to connect more with areas like Silicon Valley, the Peninsula and the East Bay that don&#8217;t have media labs in their offices,&#8221; said Reynolds. &#8220;So we thought, if we do something mobile, it will enable us to go into the communities so they don&#8217;t have to come to us all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The MoJo is equipped with a variety of electronics devices ranging from iPads and laptops to a smart TV synced to a <a href="http://www.slingbox.com/">Slingbox</a> server back at the office capable of broadcasting live TV. Alll of this is fed Internet access by two 4G mobile broadband hotspots, with plans to expand to four or five.</p>
<p>Reynolds plans to use this computing power and bandwidth to bring some of the classes taught at the company&#8217;s community media labs to area libraries, schools and senior centers. By parking at publicly accessible locations, locals won&#8217;t have to go very far to learn how to access public records or use social networking.</p>
<p>Reynolds also hopes to utilize the van to improve live coverage of breaking news and events. There are many possibilities for journalists to use the Mojo and Reynolds said it will require an open mind, as well as familiarity with the equipment, to understand its potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the challenges we&#8217;re going to face is getting the mobile lab integrated into what we all do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ideally, what would be fantastic is to have one specific person in each department who uses it consistently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Digital Transformation Editor Steve Buttry was present for the launch of the Mojo last week. Check out his blog <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/mobile-journalism-lab-rolls-into-action-for-bay-area-news-group/">for more photos and information</a>.</p>

(Steve Buttry/Digital First)" /></p><p>It has been almost three years since the Torrington Register-Citizen <a href="http://newsroomcafe.wordpress.com/">opened its newsroom</a> to the public with a community media lab and newsroom cafe. Even after <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/03/journal-registers-open-advisory-meeting-bell-jarvis-and-rosen-put-those-new-media-maxims-to-the-test/">the</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/nyregion/16towns.html">initial</a> <a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102640">buzz</a> died down, the idea of putting DFM newsrooms at the center of their communities <a href="http://www.journalregister.com/press-releases/digital-first-media-announces-12-new-community-newsroom-projects/">continued</a> to resonate with us.</p>
<p>At least 20 other Digital First newspapers from Connecticut to California have since incorporated some sort of dedicated space for the local community into their newsrooms. The offerings are as diverse as the communities served, ranging from blogging stations and community media rooms to mobile newsrooms complete with <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNewsVroom">their own Twitter presence</a>. In some locations, the community labs have become so valuable to the newsroom&#8217;s mission that dedicated staff are assigned to their operation. Heritage Media-West Managing Editor Michelle Rogers, who originally began working with her local community media labs as part of an IdeaLab project, <a href="http://idealabheritage.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/idealab-goal-morphs-into-job-at-journal-register-co-michigan-group/">recently took a new job</a> as the director of community engagement and training for Michigan&#8217;s Journal Register papers.</p>
<p>To help track the growth of these community spaces, we&#8217;ve compiled the following map of every Digital First newspaper we&#8217;re aware of that has started such a project, as well as services available and a link to their websites. If you know of a DFM newspaper that we missed, or you want to suggest a change, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1u0CHQIBZUx1uf-3lSig_OruBar6jPWwIL1WK-0k54xM/viewform?">use this form to reach us</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/02/pat_pic-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="pat_pic" /></p><p>Greetings from the world of the graduate journalism student. My name is Patrick Hogan and I will be Project Thunderdome&#8217;s first journalism intern for the spring semester. I am very excited to be a part of Thunderdome and can&#8217;t wait to get my hands dirty.</p>
<p>Here is the quick version of my biography. I have six years of professional experience as a reporter and editor at the Gazette in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and the Daily Times in Farmington, N.M. I attend New York University as part of the <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/graduate/courses-of-study/studio-20/">Studio 20 graduate journalism program</a>. When I&#8217;m not at Thunderdome or NYU, I usually can be found playing video games and tinkering around, on, or in my PC, which is named &#8220;La Banda Oriental.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been aware of Thunderdome for some time, much in the way that Pluto is aware of Jupiter (it&#8217;s really big and seems important, but it&#8217;s far away and likely won&#8217;t ever cross my path). It wasn&#8217;t until Jim Brady came to talk to my <a href="http://studio20nyu.tumblr.com/post/31986748124/kevin-convey-brings-innovation-from-the-newsroom-to-the">Studio 1 class</a> that I was motivated to take a closer look. The idea behind Thunderdome — empowering journalists at DFM&#8217;s local newspapers — resonates very strongly with me given my background working for smaller, local newspapers. I&#8217;m thrilled to be a contributing member of the team, and hope to learn a lot along the way.</p>
<p>I plan to post on this blog several times during the next few months to share my experiences &#8220;under the dome.&#8221; Most of my background is in news and reporting, but I&#8217;m very excited about the possibilities of working with the growing data and video teams here. You can also keep track of my progress through my Twitter account <a href="http://www.twitter.com/phogan">@phogan</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get this show on the road.</p>
