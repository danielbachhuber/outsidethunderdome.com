				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-06-at-12.29.49-PM-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-06 at 12.29.49 PM" /></p><p>With shrinking budgets and shrinking newsrooms, it is easy to lose sight of the importance of design when putting out a newspaper, especially for smaller newsrooms where the task of just getting the paper to bed can be overwhelming. But there are ways to refocus your staff and improve your design, without spending more time and money.</p>
<p>Here are five design tips I gathered from different sessions held at the Society for News Design conference in Louisville, Ky., that any newsroom can enact.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Plan ahead</strong></h2>
<p>Bad layout happens because of a lack of planning, says <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelwhitley" target="_blank">Mike Whitley of the L.A. Times</a>. In his <a href="http://www.sndlou.com/news/2013/08/06/l-a-times-whitley-to-speak-at-sndlou/" target="_blank">SND presentation on the paper&#8217;s annual Oscar coverage</a> Whitley said not planning ahead for major event coverage, whether it be elections or a special series, can lead to design disasters on deadline. &#8220;That&#8217;s when the worst decisions and mistakes are made,&#8221; says Whitley.</p>
<p>Always make time to plan ahead for scheduled events. Review what content you will have and how it should be presented. Planning to put your headline over a large photo? Planning ahead will allow you to shoot the photo to accommodate it. Not sure if you need a kicker headline? Print out samples to see how it might look in the end. Always short on graphics or art? Thinking ahead and commissioning what you need will prevent gray design.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Be rich, but simple</strong></h2>
<p>In an attempt to make its website more beautiful and user friendly, the staff of <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com" target="_blank">National Geographic</a> refocused on the emotion of their site&#8217;s design and the message it was sending. Their Serengeti Lion video interactive online bucked their traditional site layout for large, standalone videos that brought their online users deeper into the lions&#8217; world. It is a simple design that immerses their readers in the content.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BirIeIHVHqA" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<div id="attachment_5702" style="width: 231px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Boston.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5702   " alt="FIT TO PRINT: Picture of the Boston Globe's front page from the Boston Marathon bombing. " src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/12/Boston.jpg" width="221" height="376" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">FIT TO PRINT: The Boston Globe had many powerful images to choose from during their coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, but they didn&#8217;t cram it all into print.</p></div>
<p>Adding too many elements can take the focus away from the message and be distracting rather than enlightening. Weigh the importance of each design element and whether it would be better to leave it out. More doesn&#8217;t mean better.</p>
<p>It is better to use your best picture in a great way than to jam all the photos your staff took into print. Remember, you can always showcase every photo online.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe took this thinking to heart <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/boston-marathon-explosions" target="_blank">when covering the Boston Marathon bombings</a>. Rather than getting every great photo in, they edited it down to a few and only ran the very best.</p>
<h2>3. Steal from yourself</h2>
<p>&#8220;Look back at your work, it will give you perspective,&#8221; advised Whitley in his Oscars speech. If you have several different ideas for a project that you undertake every year, write the ones you don&#8217;t use down and refer to them the next time around. This will give you a starting point and put you ahead of the game when you begin to plan again.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t be afraid to repackage an old idea. &#8220;Different doesn&#8217;t mean better,&#8221; said Whitley. &#8220;Readers don&#8217;t remember things the way your newsroom does.&#8221; If a certain design style showcases your content best for a recurring event, don&#8217;t change it because you are bored, change it only if it truly improves the experience of your content.</p>
<h2>4. Take risks</h2>
<p>It is OK to admit something doesn&#8217;t work, says Whitley. Stop doing things because &#8220;we&#8217;ve always done it this way,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>Instead of a main photo to illustrate your story, why not think ahead and commission artwork instead?  Why not forgo a story entirely and instead create an infographic that expresses the same information in a more interesting way?</p>
<p>For their pre-Oscar coverage one year, the Times decided to forgo the usual cover photos for their section and instead commissioned several illustrations that when put side-by-side created one continuous poster celebrating the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>In 2013, the paper decided instead of placing notable quotes from stars at the top of pages in their awards coverage section, all the quotes were posted in bubbles on a back page, which garnered them much more attention.</p>
<p>Taking risks could mean a drastic change in your layout, or bucking your old content management system and choosing an alternative web design or outside site to better present your content.</p>
<h2>5. Solicit feedback</h2>
<p>Everyone can use feedback, from leaders to the lowest man on the totem pole, and it doesn&#8217;t require long meetings. It may be as simple as posting your layout or design ideas up for all to see and asking the rest of the staff to weigh in when they can.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be willing to hear others&#8217; ideas,&#8221; advised Whitley. You never know where serendipity could come from.</p>
<p>Try not to overreact to your work or the work of others, Whitley advised. And when you give feedback, make it constructive.</p>
<p>Remember, it takes everyone in your newsroom to make things great. No matter how big or small the team is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/abortionmap-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="abortionmap" /></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This is the second in a series of reports from two Digital First Media journalists who attended SND through the <a title="Digital First Represents #SND13: And the winner is …" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/10/18/digital-first-represents-snd13-winner/" target="_blank">Digital First Represents</a> program. </em></p>
<p>We’ve all been guilty of it — desperate for art to break up the gray text of a school budget, graduation rate or tax story, we create a data table to illustrate the numbers or a map to show where the issue or event is playing out. Yet it doesn’t add much context.</p>
<p>Instead of falling prey to the standard chart or illustrative graphic that takes up space without adding to readers&#8217; understanding. Next time, take the extra time to call in some newsroom assistance that could help make your graphics and charts more informative and useful to readers. Here is some advice I learned at the Society for News Design (<a title="#SNDLOU: Live updates from DFM’s Eileen Faust and Brian Harr" href="http://insidethunderdome.com/2013/11/07/dfm-journalists-report-live-sndlou-workshop/">SND</a>) workshop earlier this month.</p>
<p><strong>1. Your graphic or chart should strengthen the idea of your story. </strong>If it’s repetitious and doesn’t add to the story, is it really worth using?</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5096 alignright" alt="abortion map A" src="http://insidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/11/abortion-map-A.jpg" width="384" height="367" /></p>
<p>“Really good charts should provide memorable context,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdaniel" target="_blank">Jennifer Daniel</a>, New York Times graphics editor. In her Society for News Design speech, Daniels demonstrated what she meant by showing a plain graphic that illustrated where abortion was legal, similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_US_abortion_laws_pre-1973.svg" target="_blank">this one from Wikipedia:</a></p>
<p>Compare that to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/graphics/2013_bwg_abortion/ab_index_edit.html" target="_blank">this Businessweek graphic</a> which illustrates the myriad laws that govern abortion in each state, showing how the restrictions could be just as prohibitive as an outright ban. This takes the illustration much farther for readers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mapping an idea doesn’t always mean creating a map</strong>. Daniels encouraged us to think outside the box on how to graphically represent data to make it clearer, and more insightful. Ask yourself how your chart can reveal patterns in the data that would otherwise be hard to see.</p>
<p>“The information should reveal itself through the structure of the graphic,” says Daniels. That’s what makes good graphics work. Like this one from <a href="http://visual.ly/marathon-meal" target="_blank">Newman Design on Visual.ly</a> that shows how much walking you will have to do for each item on your Thanksgiving meal plate.</p>
<div class="visually_embed"><img class="visually_embed_infographic" alt="Marathon Meal" src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/marathon-meal_50290c06ab72e_w587.png" /></p>
<div class="visually_embed_cycle"><em>Explore more <a href="http://visual.ly">infographics</a> like this one on the web&#8217;s largest information design community &#8211; <a href="http://visual.ly">Visually</a>.</em></div>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Get feedback.</strong> The worst thing to do is to get locked into your own space, says Daniels. Instead, rely on the intelligence of the people around you, and don’t be overly protective of your ideas. Your coworkers may be able to see the idea in a new light and suggest a better way to illustrate the data or even suggest additional information that could add more context. The end result is not about you, it is about telling the story and creating the best infographic possible.</p>
<p><strong>4. Plan ahead.</strong> If you are always running stories about the same topics, or know a big project or story is in the works, start working on the graphic ahead of time so you don’t have to come up with a quick, weak version just to make your space less grey.</p>
<p><strong>5. Publish your print graphics on the web.</strong> There are numerous free and low-cost graphic makers available online that will give you both an interactive and print graphic. Check some of these out before starting your next illustrated project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#fusiontables" target="_blank"><strong>Fusion Tables</strong></a>: A free Google tool, this allows you to create maps and basic charts, and it is only limited by your imagination. Check out <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fusiontablestalks/stories" target="_blank">examples of graphs and maps others have created</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?kw=semgeneric&amp;sdid=JRSIH&amp;skwcid=AL!3085!3!28214304396!e!!g!!adobe%20illustrator&amp;ef_id=PQdQJWg@70gAAE45:20131120233427:s" target="_blank"><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></a>: Many newsrooms will have at least one copy of this software and at least one user who knows its ins and outs. Collaborate with them to make your vision a reality. Or, if there isn&#8217;t anyone versed in Illustrator, <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/19/adobe-illustrator-tutorials/" target="_blank">check out these free tutorials from Mashable</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://infogr.am" target="_blank"><strong>Infogr.am</strong></a>: This online graphics maker comes in free and pro versions. The free version doesn’t offer icons or a graphics library. You will have to add almost anything you are using, but it does provide you with a basic online graphic for free.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.easel.ly" target="_blank">Easel.ly</a></strong>: This site offers templates that you can work off of to create quick graphics if you aren’t comfortable using complex software. It’s free to use, and like it&#8217;s name implies, easy to use as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.piktochart.com" target="_blank"><strong>Piktochart</strong></a>: This site charges a monthly fee, though there are scales for subscription. It does offer a free trial.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com" target="_blank"><strong>Tableau</strong></a>: Downloadable software that allows you to create graphics offline. There are two versions; business and public use. Journalists can use the public online software available for free.</p>
