(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)" /></p><p style="text-align: left">In October, the Thunderdome politics channel dubbed President Obama <a href="http://www.dfmpolitics.com/2012/10/obama-the-first-meme-president/">&#8220;the first meme president.&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Roosevelt had the radio. Kennedy had television. Barack Obama, as it turned out, had memes.</p>
<p>The four years that Obama has served in the White House coincided with an explosion in Internet memes — Photoshopped images that are passed around via email, blogs, Twitter and Facebook and popularized on sites such as Reddit and Tumblr.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story became pretty viral itself, picking up mentions on <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/10/24/the_first_meme_president.html">Taegan Goddard&#8217;s Political Wire</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/10/24/opening_act_off_the_record.html">Slate</a>, <a href="http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/election-memes-2012-11/">New York Magazine</a> and <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/24/mercurynews-compolitics.html">Boing Boing</a>, among other places. As Wired&#8217;s Spencer Ackerman noted in an election roundup, &#8220;Obama being the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/politics-national/2012/10/obama-the-first-meme-president/">First Meme President</a> itself became a meme.&#8221;</p>
<p>We noted that Obama seemed to play a role in popularizing many of these memes. Since the story ran, we&#8217;ve learned a bit more about the president&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the photo above, which was taken by a White House photographer during a visit by McKayla Maroney, a member of the U.S. Olympics gymnastic team. Maroney is also known for the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mckayla-is-not-impressed">&#8220;McKayla is not impressed&#8221; meme</a> which began after she was photographed making the above facial expression during the Olympics. This is a classic example of Obama&#8217;s Internet-savvy approach.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the question of why Obama has been so engaged with Internet memes. The answer to that comes from Time&#8217;s Michael Scherer in a story about the <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/07/inside-the-secret-world-of-quants-and-data-crunchers-who-helped-obama-win/#ixzz2DQfb99h6">&#8220;data-driven campaign&#8221;</a> that helped Obama turn out the vote.</p>
<blockquote><p>The numbers also led the campaign to escort their man down roads not usually taken in the late stages of a presidential campaign. In August, Obama decided to answer questions on the social news website Reddit, which many of the President’s senior aides did not know about. “Why did we put Barack Obama on Reddit?” an official asked rhetorically. “Because a whole bunch of our turnout targets were on Reddit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the success of the Reddit chat and various memes, expect to see other politicians follow Obama&#8217;s lead. He may be the first meme president, but he won&#8217;t be the last.</p>
