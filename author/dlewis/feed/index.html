		<description><![CDATA[For Dan Lewis, joining Thunderdome as a features producer meant swapping out hiking boots for dress shoes and work gloves for a briefcase.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/05/902783_592814074064748_807284171_o-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Daniel Lewis stands with his parents, Matthew and Paula, after the graduation ceremony at Brigham Young University on April 26, 2013. Dan is the most recent addition to the Thunderdome features team. (Personal file)" /></p><p>I&#8217;m a country boy at heart. I&#8217;d rather be figuring out how to reel in a fish than how to navigate from lower Manhattan to JFK. I was raised in a place where I learned to appreciate the surrounding mountains, and now I am learning to appreciate the towering skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline.</p>
<p>Beginning a career with Thunderdome is a big change for me. I had to swap out my hiking boots for dress shoes, and my work gloves for a briefcase.</p>
<p>I believe that the world needs journalism. In a world where information is available at the click of a button, 24 hours a day, people have never been more connected with one another than they are today. This demand for information means that journalists have a responsibility to provide content that is better than ever. Content needs to be available immediately while faithfully adhering to the journalistic tenets of accuracy, neutrality and credibility.</p>
<p>The Thunderdome family can meet the demands of modern journalism. I was blown away by the caliber of journalists who have been assembled in the lower Manhattan office. Award-winning journalists and editors have been thrown in with eager young staff members to create an atmosphere that beats with energy and optimism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to joining the features desk and working alongside our channel managers to produce content for DFM&#8217;s many publications. I&#8217;ll be working with other producers to provide support through the day, taking a handoff from the morning producer and continuing to share news into the evening.</p>
<p>Will I miss those nights of lying out by a campfire, staring up at the night sky? Of course, but I&#8217;m happy with my choice and excited to have started. Those quiet nights will be there when my work is finished.</p>
