<p><a title="Susan Steade" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/susan-steade/13/509/886">Susan Steade</a> of the Bay Area News Group wins the DFMie for SEO headline writing.</p>
<p>Her editors&#8217; nomination explains the impact of her search-engine optimization expertise:</p>
<blockquote><p>BANG producer Susan Steade has a special knack for taking a flat web headline and applying some SEO magic that gives an almost immediate boost in search engine ranking and traffic. A few of her tricks: SEO headlines are like a mullet – &#8220;Business up front, party in the back&#8221; – which simply means get the words people search for at the front of the headline, and don’t be afraid of using a colon. (Credit for the mullet line goes to producer Kimberly Chua.) Play up hot angles (and look at Google, Twitter and Yahoo to see what is trending and the words being used). And just use common sense – if you wanted to find the story, what words would you use. Get them in the head.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nomination included headlines Steade had rewritten, with before-and-after metrics. For instance, she changed &#8220;Stanford abuzz over link to make-believe leading lady in Notre Dame football star’s love hoax&#8221; to &#8220;<a title="Manti Te'o hoax ..." href="http://www.mercurynews.com/stanford-cardinal/ci_22398271/manti-teo-stanford-link-fake-girlfriend">Manti Te’o hoax has Stanford abuzz over link to fake girlfriend</a>,&#8221; resulting in this traffic spike:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/dfm/susan-steade/manti-teo-headline/" rel="attachment wp-att-3312"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3312" alt="Manti Te'o headline" src="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Manti-Teo-headline.gif" width="432" height="216" /></a>Other winning headlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" title="San Jose man in bank bomb plot ..." href="http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_22576492/civil-rights-groups-assail-fbi-tactics-san-jose">San Jose man in bank bomb plot: Terrorist or delusional wannabe?</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Judges explained why Steade was the winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>BANG producer Susan Steade&#8217;s headlines find that SEO sweet spot by sounding at once authoritative, accessible and engaging. Her thorough analysis of what&#8217;s trending and an evident understanding of how the public searches for content produce headlines that stand out and pull readers into the story. By taking time to find the essence of each story, hone in on the words that pop and craft an compelling message, Susan&#8217;s deceptively strategic headlines clearly improve results and generate traffic.</p></blockquote>
<p>When Steade&#8217;s editor asked her for 10 examples of strong SEO headlines cited in her weekly email to BANG staff, she didn&#8217;t realize they were gathering them for a contest entry. Upon being informed of her award, Steade quickly pointed out that two of the 10 winning headlines were authored by Ann Tatko-Peterson (&#8220;<a title="Harlem Shake craze ..." href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-living/ci_22592216/harlem-shake-craze-jolts-internet-and-beyond">Harlem Shake videos, with 44 million views, have gone mainstream</a>&#8220;) and Robert Salonga (&#8220;<a title="Monte Sereno slaying ..." href="http://www.mercurynews.com/los-gatos/ci_22690909/monte-sereno-slaying-alleged-prostitute-facing-murder-charge">Monte Sereno slaying: Documents show how hooker harem got millionaire mixed up with gang robbers</a>&#8220;). Since Steade wrote eight of the 10 headlines in the entry, DFM honors her as the winner, with special mention for Tatko-Peterson and Salonga, who each will receive an appropriate cash prize.</p>
<p>Other finalists for the SEO DFMie were Jerry Berrios of the Los Angeles Daily News, the New Haven Register&#8217;s breaking news team and Anna Cekola of the Salt Lake Tribune.</p>
<p>Steade became a BANG producer in 2009, after more than 20 years with the San Jose Mercury News. Her newsroom posts included news and sports designer, copy editor and editor of the outdoors section.</p>
<p>On the digital side she started as business and technology producer, and the secondary blogger for Good Morning Silicon Valley, then switched to news producer for BANG South Bay. Her favorite projects this year are the <a title="Bay Area homicides 2013" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/homicides">Bay Area homicide map</a> and the <a title="South Bay history " href="http://www.mercurynews.com/history">South Bay history</a> page.</p>
<p>Susan grew up in Fort Collins, Colo., and studied movies at UCLA. She lives on the San Francisco Peninsula with her husband, David, and their daughter, Alex, 10.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[DFMie judges chose Tim O'Rourke of the Bay Area News Group as Copy Editor of the Year.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/Tim-ORourke-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Tim O&#039;Rourke" /></p><p>DFMie judges chose <a title="Tim O'Rourke" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timothyorourke">Tim O&#8217;Rourke</a> of the Bay Area News Group as Copy Editor of the Year.</p>
<p>The nomination by his editors explains O’Rourke’s important role:</p>
<blockquote><p>A year ago, Tim O&#8217;Rourke considered leaving the &#8220;newspaper&#8221; business. Today, he is senior copy desk chief for digital and print content for the Bay Area News Group. As the lengthy title implies, Tim holds arguably the most complicated job in today’s newsroom.</p>
<p>He’s still a traditional copy desk chief, making the biggest catches each week, shepherding style guidelines, slotting the newspapers’ most important stories and writing headlines as strong or as witty as anyone.</p>
<p>But he is also one of the news group’s driving forces in the push to digital. Tim recognized the importance of clicks right away, and he championed the creation of “clickboxes,” files paired with our stories that we link to online and which have resulted in hundreds of thousands of hits we wouldn’t have otherwise garnered. He did his homework and has been a leader in teaching others about SEO. He has led training sessions on these and other topics.</p>
<p>Tim was the major conduit for a workflow change that allowed us to focus our priorities on digital platforms, despite creating much more work for himself.</p>
<p>In addition, Tim writes the work schedules for nearly 40 employees and acts as a liaison to other departments, serves on many committees, devises workflows and administers evaluations. Yes, he’s busy. But he’s a funny, humble, newsroom-type guy whose demanding standards make everyone around him a better journalist. We are excited to nominate Tim O’Rourke for DFM’s Copy Editor of the Year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The judges explained their choice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tim O&#8217;Rourke wins the DFMie for Copy Editor of the Year for crafting clear prose, driving digital transformation and maintaining high standards across the Bay Area News Group&#8217;s multiple platforms. His headlines were not only crisp and clever, they were also appropriate and representative of the accompanying stories. On the humorous side, we got a kick out of &#8216;Ouchville&#8217; and &#8216;Gaps     anger    drivers.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for Copy Editor of the Year were <a title="Philip Maramba" href="https://twitter.com/DailyMailPhilip">Philip Maramba</a> of the Charleston Daily Mail and <a title="Jeanette Dunn" href="https://twitter.com/DunnJeanette">Jeanette Dunn</a> of the Los Angeles News Group.</p>
<p>O’Rourke leads copy desk operations for the San Jose Mercury News, Contra Costa Times, Oakland Tribune and other Digital First Media newspapers and digital platforms in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>He came to the Times in 2007 and has worked in many positions and on even more publications. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Saint Mary&#8217;s College of California and graduated from the University of Oregon Graduate School of Journalism in 2006. When he&#8217;s not editing, organizing and helping manage the copy and design desks, O&#8217;Rourke writes restaurant reviews and other Food+Wine stories for the BANG features department.</p>
<p>He is getting married in August to his fiancee, Kate. Together, they try to keep in line a miniature dachshund, Dottie, and a pug named Fuji.</p>

Post editors detailed the coverage in their nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Post&#8217;s response to the Aurora theater shootings was to publish thousands of stories, Tweets, Facebook posts, photos, videos and interactive elements – all as staffers coped with the emotional toll.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">The main, posted at 2:42 a.m. without benefit of police briefings, was updated 36 times in 18 hours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">The report included photos and videos from staff and public at the scene.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">A live blog included reporters and community members who were reliving a mass shooting similar to the Columbine tragedy.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Interactive maps and timelines in first 12 hours.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We digitally fed the appetite for information Friday, we produced 14 pages for Saturday, and kept this pace for days.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Pulitzer nomination letter by Post Editor <a title="Greg Moore" href="https://twitter.com/gregmooredp">Greg Moore</a> provided more detail on the Post&#8217;s coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>A newsroom grows quiet after midnight. Down to just a couple digital producers, The Denver Post was no different as July 19 gave way to the 20th. Just 39 minutes into that summer day, the quiet was shattered.</p>
<p>An Aurora, Colorado, police dispatcher calmly put out a call for units to head to a movie theater to check out reports of shots fired – not an uncommon event in a metropolitan area. But the second dispatch was different: “There is one person who has been shot. But they say there are hundreds of people running around.” Nearing 1 a.m., Night Producer Paul Soriano was about to turn off the lights. He immediately called the Post’s night city editor and the newsroom roared back to life.</p>
<p>With reporters, photographers and videographers blanketing the scene, the horrific details were published through social media and denverpost.com: 12 dead; 58 injured; panicked survivors; chaos at the 16-screen theater.</p>
<p>Once again, Colorado would be ground zero to mass murder.</p>
<p>In the first few hours after the shooting, we had journalists from every department in the newsroom assigned to dozens of angles. The entire first day of the massacre was published on our digital platforms with updates virtually by the minute. Our social media team was aggressive and creative. Our visual team was beaming the images around the world. We were the primary source for accurate information about the number of dead, the number of wounded and produced the definitive account of what happened in Theater 9 after a man opened fire with an arsenal during the midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises.”</p>
<p>And so began days of around-the-clock coverage. The Denver Post published thousands of stories, Tweets, Facebook posts, photos, videos and interactive elements – all as reporters and editors tried to cope with the emotional toll of the grisly news:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our first Tweet went out at 1:47 a.m.</li>
<li>Determined to publish only what we could confirm, our main breaking news story was first published at 2:42 a.m. without the benefit of police briefings. We updated it 36 times in the first 18 hours after the shooting.</li>
<li>Our main Twitter and Facebook accounts were both pushing and pulling information. Post reporters and photographers were posting information and images on their accounts while editors in the newsroom would fashion the stories from those details.</li>
<li>We published videos from both staff and the public at the scene.</li>
<li>We tended to a live blog that included our reporters as well as community members. That feature was actively managed for four days after the shooting.</li>
<li>We posted interactive maps and timelines in the first 12 hours.</li>
<li>We analyzed and posted audio files of the police and fire radio traffic.</li>
<li>We facilitated conversations on Facebook and our commenting platform for a community stunned to be reliving the trauma after enduring the deadly Columbine school shooting in 1999.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we fed the insatiable appetite for information Friday on our digital platforms, we began planning 14 pages of coverage for Saturday’s newspaper. Included in that report was a graphic of the scene, profiles of victims who had been identified, the anguish of the survivors, details of selfless acts of heroism, a meaty profile of suspect James Holmes and the shocking news that he had booby-trapped his apartment in an apparent attempt to injure first responders and neighbors. And we repeated that performance day after day:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Day 2, while police and bomb experts were successfully untangling the explosives at the suspect’s apartment, officials released the names of the 12 victims. We were on the scene of the apartment, reporting in real time. We put several staffers to the task of profiling each of the victims – online and in print.</li>
<li>On Day 3 the community stopped to remember. Thousands arrived – some driving hours to pay their respects. The makeshift memorial was growing by the minute and President Barack Obama landed to visit hospitals and speak to the community.</li>
<li>On Day 4, we got our first look at James Holmes as he appeared in court. With “a tangle of orangish-red hair atop his head like a bizarre costume wig,” Holmes barely paid attention. The legal battle had begun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incredibly, we were able to maintain this pace of reporting for several days, including producing a special section extolling the heroic acts of people inside the theater, and an enterprise story raising serious questions about how ambulances responded to the shooting.</p>
<p>For the first 96 hours, media from around the world created a frenzy in Aurora. We were determined to be aggressive but measured, fast but accurate – our community would demand that. There were inaccurate rumors on the death count, the background of the suspect and investigation information that hit other outlets – but not one appeared on Denver Post platforms.</p>
<p>Our supplemental material includes a log of our major digital elements during the first four days, the main story from Saturday’s newspaper, an enterprise story on the poor response of ambulance crews, a story on the immediate spike in gun sale permits, PDFs of our daily newspaper coverage, PDFs of the denverpost.com home page as it progressed through the weekend, PDFs and stories from our special section Heroes Among Us, and a video from that effort.</p>
<p>We are proud of the ways we served our community during this tragic story. There is no forecast for a mass shooting. There is no chance to halt vacations, plan stories or prepare the staff. There is only the training, skill and drive of your newsroom.</p>
<p>We are pleased to submit our coverage of the Aurora theater shootings for consideration for the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting of Breaking News.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges joined those praising the Post&#8217;s coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sophisticated and humanizing reporting, elegant writing, Pulitzer-caliber photography, chilling graphics and other informative visuals provided readers with a compelling description and analysis of the Aurora, Colo., theater massacre. The coverage offered reliable clarity when readers needed to know the basic facts, and showed impressive enterprise in guiding readers to new places. We also admired the restraint and clear sense of purpose apparent in the use of social media.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/07/Mile-High-Mamas-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Mile High Mamas" /></p><p><a title="Mile High Mamas" href="http://www.milehighmamas.com">Mile High Mamas</a> wins the DFMie for Community Blog, the only DFMie not awarded to a Digital First Media staff member.</p>
<p>DFM encourages newsrooms to network with community blogs, showcasing their local content on news sites and driving traffic to other outlets with news and information about community life. This award recognizes the success of the Denver blog founded by Amber Johnson.</p>
<p>Denver Post editors explained the success of the blog in their nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mile High Mamas was created as an entertaining community resource for area moms. The site includes regular posts by some of Colorado&#8217;s most popular Mommy Bloggers, a message board, monthly cutest kid contest, and a Mama Drama advice column. They also hold regular giveaways and product reviews.</p>
<p>The site was the brainchild of Amber Johnson, and she is the glue that keeps the whole thing running. She is constantly updating the blog postings so that different voices are represented on the pages, and gives readers many reasons to keep coming back. And the metrics year over year speak for themselves: 2012 pageviews: 689,078; 2011 pageviews: 456,369.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained their choice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our pick for community blogger is Mile High Mamas, a wonderful blog with a compelling, entertaining mix of personal pieces, intriguing questions, spotlights on events and tips and far more. Parenting blogs are a digital staple, but many aren&#8217;t worth the time their authors or readers put into them. But Mile High Mamas, which offers posts that are consistently useful, not to mention a robust forum and a cute kids photo contest/gallery that&#8217;s hard not to click through at least occasionally. This is a blog that&#8217;s grown into a community that readers have made their own, and that any town would envy.</p></blockquote>

<p><a title="Peggy Fletcher Stack" href="https://twitter.com/religiongal">Peggy Fletcher Stack</a> and <a title="Lee Davidson" href="https://twitter.com/LeeHDavidson">Lee Davidson</a> of the Salt Lake Tribune win the DFMie for best political journalism for their <a title="Mormon view on the role of governing is distinct" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home2/53115419-183/church-lds-mormon-leaders.html.csp">coverage of the role</a> <a title="Mormon views of wealth, welfare and the economy" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home2/53201394-183/mormon-says-lds-church.html.csp">Mitt Romney&#8217;s Mormon faith</a> <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/54211325-80/romney-black-obama-says.html.csp">played in the 2012 presidential election</a>.</p>
<p>The nomination by Editor Nancy Conway explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Mormon-dominated Utah, watching the national press wrestle with Mitt Romney&#8217;s religion was like watching anthropologists descend on an Amazon tribe. For Salt Lake Tribune writers, the challenge was to capture the nation&#8217;s Mormon curiosity for an audience that is already plenty familiar with the faith. Tribune stories brought a layer of depth that even more prominent publications like the New York Times could not penetrate. In fact, despite worldwide attention, it just didn&#8217;t happen that The Tribune was beaten on a Mormon angle in the year of the Mormon Moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why Fletcher and Davidson&#8217;s coverage was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Salt Lake City Tribune&#8217;s political journalism entry offered readers stories during the 2012 presidential election that no other outlet was as ideally situated to provide—insights into how the Mormon faith of a candidate, such as Mitt Romney, or of a voter, might inform his or her values and views on governance. Rather than settling for perennial and somewhat tired election-year story angles, Peggy Fletcher Stack dove directly into a sensitive topic and found sources to explain the breadth of opinions held by Mormons and the Church of LDS on topics such as wealth, welfare, the economy and government, as well as the church&#8217;s uncomfortable history with black people. It would have been easy to follow the national pack&#8217;s monolithic treatment of Mormonism, religion and politics. Instead, the Tribune provided in-depth, intelligent information that could truly aid voters in their decision-making.</p></blockquote>

<div id="attachment_3306" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/charleston-daily-mail/zack-harold-wins-dfmie-social-media/zack-harold/" rel="attachment wp-att-3306"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3306" alt="Zack Harold" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Zack-Harold-259x300.jpg" width="259" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zack Harold</p></div>
<p><a title="Zack Harold" href="http://muckrack.com/ZackHarold">Zack Harold</a> of the Charleston Daily Mail wins the DFMie for best use of social media for his <a title="Major explosion in Sissonville" href="http://storify.com/zackharold/possible-explosion-in-sissonville">coverage of a pipeline explosion in West Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>His editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zack Harold spearheaded our social media coverage of a gas pipeline explosion on Dec. 11. The pipeline caused a monster fireball that rumbled toward Interstate 77, scorching homes, burning trees, melting cars and making the highway asphalt crumble. As the situation developed, Zack used Storify to compile social media updates from media and residents about what was happening at the scene. The Storify served as a reservoir of breaking news and reaction, and received 4,677 views.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judges explained why this was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zack Harold&#8217;s Storify of the Sissonville explosion is a great example of how journalists can use social media to provide useful information during a breaking news event. Harold showed a great deal of insight into what people would want to know during the event &#8212; where to go for shelter, which roads were closed, reports of any injuries &#8212; and what they might want to know afterwards, like how asphalt actually melted during the gas line explosion. He also guided those who weren&#8217;t familiar with Storify as a tool, by reminding them how to use it along the way. By giving multiple accounts of the accident, gathering pictures from social media, and pulling from the official emergency response messages, he was able to give a well-rounded picture of what was going on in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists in the social media category were:</p>

<p><a title="Tom Kelly IV" href="http://www.tk4photo.blogspot.com/">Tom Kelly IV</a> of the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa., wins the DFMie for the best visual journalism of 2012.</p>
<p>His editor&#8217;s nomination explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>These photographs were chosen for a number of reasons, but most importantly the impact they had on the print edition readers and web version viewers. These photos include photographing a hot air balloon from above, documenting police talking a man off a ledge six stories up, the thrill of victory for a local football team, the loss of a firefighter, the murder of a police officer, and the burial of a Marine. Then the funerals for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting, and the burial of 57 Irish railroad laborers who died in 1832. Great work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained their selection:</p>
<blockquote><p>We chose Tom Kelly of the Daily Local News for the artistry of his individual shots, the focus on moments within moments in many of the photographs that conveyed the joy, the grief or the solemnity of the events. This photographer reminded us that in a world of fast-moving, high-definition images packaged with sound and words, sometimes a simple, well-composed image still speaks volumes.</p></blockquote>

Reynolds addresses graduates of the Oakland Voices program, which he had originally conceived and has continued to run. Reynolds was named Innovator of the Year for this and other efforts like it. (George Kelly/Bay Area News Group)" /></p><div id="attachment_3198" style="width: 229px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/oakland-tribune/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/martin-reynolds/" rel="attachment wp-att-3198"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3198" alt="Martin G. Reynolds" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Martin-Reynolds-219x300.jpg" width="219" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Martin G. Reynolds</p></div>
<p>Judges chose <a title="Martin G. Reynolds" href="https://twitter.com/reynoldspost">Martin G. Reynolds</a> as Innovator of the Year for 2012 in Digital First Media newsrooms.</p>
<p>“The projects Martin has spearheaded continue to push the Tribune and Bay Area News Group in new and dynamic directions,&#8221; Oakland Tribune Managing Editor Pamela Turntine said of Reynolds, former editor of the Tribune. &#8220;He truly is an innovator in our organization and in our industry.”</p>
<p>The nomination by BANG East Bay Metro Editor Katherine Rowlands (lightly edited here) explains Reynolds&#8217; innovative leadership:</p>
<blockquote><p>Martin G. Reynolds, senior editor for community engagement for BANG and DFM’s Western Region, has been an innovator since he began his tenure at The Oakland Tribune as an intern in 1995. Since taking on his new role, Reynolds has spearheaded innovative projects that touch on key areas of emphasis for the company.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/oakland-tribune/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/oakland-voices-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3205"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3205" alt="Oakland Voices" src="/content/uploads/2013/06/Oakland-Voices.png" width="101" height="126" /></a>Oakland Voices</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ground-breaking community storytelling project was co-founded by Reynolds after three years of planning. Since its start in 2010-11, OV has graduated 18 correspondents and published more than 200 stories online and in print, with only one minor correction.</li>
<li>Reynolds found funding for the project from The California Endowment and approached members of BANG’s Operating Committee to get in-kind support from Facilities, Online and IT.</li>
<li>Reynolds worked on every component of the project, including the training curriculum, participant selection, website design, editing and overseeing grant content goals.</li>
<li>Reynolds personally wrote the initial proposal to support the project and co-wrote the most recent grant that supported the 2012-13 class of OV correspondents.</li>
<li>Reynolds worked to assuage early concerns raised by assigning and line editors about the non-traditional tone of OV content, which ultimately led to greater acceptance.</li>
<li>The success of the 2012-13 OV class has fueled current efforts to expand Voices beyond Oakland to LANG and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Philanthropic supported reporting project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Over the past year, Reynolds has co-authored grants totaling $340,000 from The California Endowment to support reporting and community engagement efforts.</li>
<li>These funds went to support the most recent class of Oakland Voices, and the continuing work of Violence Reporting Fellow Scott Johnson, whose position was among the first endowed reporting beats in the nation. The <a title="Oakland Effect" href="http://www.oaklandeffect.com">Oakland Effect </a>project set a precedent for the creation of such beats, which have since been replicated in other news organizations such as The McClatchy Company.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">At Reynolds’ direction, the violence reporting fellowship also paired Johnson with Oakland Voices correspondents who produced a joint reporting assignment called </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem" href="http://www.oaklandeffect.com/voices-oakland/">“Health in the Hood,”</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem"> where correspondents surveyed their neighborhoods to assess what makes them more or less healthy places to live. </span></li>
<li>The fellowship also included unique community engagement components such as a series of <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_20244226/www.siliconvalley.com/ces?source=inthenews">public forums</a>, webinars, and a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_20955082/fourm-seeks-start-conversation-about-gun-violence">forum Johnson moderated</a> on gun laws following the Aurora, Colorado shooting. These engagement efforts were highlighted as a model at a recent USC Annenberg School of Journalism conference.</li>
<li>Johnson has won three CNPA awards for his work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ongoing engagement work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since taking over his new role as engagement editor, with no designated budget or staff, Reynolds has set the standard for face-to-face engagement, planning 20 community engagement classes, eight engagement mixers, the Oakland Tribune grand opening and 11 public forums.</li>
<li>Reynolds recently penned “The Engagement Playbook” for editors in LANG which served as a blueprint for the group’s emerging engagement efforts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why Reynolds was the winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Innovation is often the first victim of tight budgets, so Martin G. Reynolds&#8217; achievement in nurturing various collaborative reporting and engagement projects for the Oakland Tribune is particularly impressive. Oakland Voices, which Reynolds co-founded, offers varied, often unexpected insights into the community it serves by members of that community. OaklandEffect.com provides a powerful, provocative perspective on crime of value to audiences well beyond the Bay Area. We also appreciate that he is extending his innovation to the equally important financial side, a rarity for journalists.</p></blockquote>

Designer <a title="Samantha Dellinger" href="http://www.yorkblog.com/artist/">Samantha Dellinger</a> of the York Daily Record wins the DFMie for best print front page for her cover on the death of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.</p>
<p>Her editors&#8217; nomination explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samantha Dellinger’s “JoePa” page design sought to strike the right balance for an avid Penn State readership the day after Joe Paterno died, a major news story.</p>
<p>The image size and design simplicity project the story’s significance. The photo captures Paterno, unmistakable even from behind, in his element, but moving away toward brighter skies. (Paterno’s role in the Freeh Report was not yet known). Readers told us they appreciated our approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>DFMie judge explained why the page was a winner:</p>
<blockquote><p>We chose Samantha Dellinger’s “JoePa” front-page design for its elegance and simplicity. Paterno, his back to the camera, looms larger than life in the setting of his beloved Penn State. His figure against a lively stadium fills the entire page, unencumbered by competing messages. For fan and critic alike, we imagine there was no bigger story that day, and the singular focus of this design captures that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for best print front page were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Bob Carville" href="https://twitter.com/bcarville">Bob Carville</a> of the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa., for his front page covering the theater massacre in Auroro, Colo.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="150" height="150" src="http://outsidethunderdome.com/content/uploads/2013/06/NewsVroom-1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Among the many people from the York Daily Record and York Newspaper Co. who helped conduct an array of NewsVroom events are, from left, Assistant Sports Editor Brittany Wilson, GameTimePA Editor Elizabeth Jones, Books Editor Sarah Chain, Smart magazine Editor April Trotter, Managing Editor Randy Parker, Graphic Artist Samantha Dellinger and Visual Editor Eileen Joyce." /></p><p>Judges chose the <a href="http://ydr.com">York Daily Record</a>’s <a title="NewsVroom" href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/">NewsVroom</a> as the best community engagement project of 2012.</p>
<p>Editors explained the project in their nomination:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spreading and sharing the message “The York Daily Record is not a newspaper” is a challenge we face head-on every day. To help with that community outreach effort and accelerate York County’s transition into the digital age, The York Daily Record/Sunday News launched <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/"><b>NewsVroom</b></a> in the late summer 2012.</p>
<p>NewsVroom is our mobile media lab – a new-media classroom on wheels. It’s equipped with laptops, smartphones, tablets and wi-fi and visits an array of community events; everything from <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/2012/10/30/the-newsvroom-stops-by-the-kennard-dale-vs-susquehannock-football-game/">high school football games</a> and emergency personnel groups to library workshops and Boy Scout pancake breakfasts.</p>
<p>With each visit, we create a hands-on experience to boost the public’s understanding of how both we and the public can use new technology to share news and information.</p>
<p>Since August we have shown the public how to take good photos with their smart phones, how to comment on our live blogs and download our apps. We’ve shown them how to share their photos and promote them on social media. We connected with readers through <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNewsVroom">our Twitter account</a>, our Facebook page and our blog. Most importantly, we’ve asked the community how we can better serve them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/2013/03/26/newsvroom-under-the-stars/#more-5025">And we’ve received some terrific feedback after our visits.</a></p>
<p>The NewsVroom’s reach has been so successful, we have been fielding requests for one to two community visits a week. We might just need another van.</p>
<p>Want to learn more? Here’s a <a href="http://sfy.co/fH1w">quick recap of the past six months. </a></p></blockquote>
<p>Judges explained why they chose York for the DFMie:</p>
<blockquote><p>The NewsVroom sticks out for its continued impact as an ongoing project; this is engagement that doesn&#8217;t end after a news cycle. It recognizes that face-to-face engagement can be more powerful than a clever hashtag, yet uses social media to facilitate and build upon those meaningful connections. We look forward to seeing what value this creates for the newsroom down the road, whether it&#8217;s power users of the app who were recruited at a football game, or community voices who become sources after becoming empowered in a class.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other finalists for the best community engagement project were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Diane Hoffman" href="https://twitter.com/diane5hoffman">Diane Hoffman</a>, <a title="Eileen Faust" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/eileenefaust">Eileen Faust</a> and <a title="Brandie Kessler" href="https://twitter.com/I_M_BrandieK">Brandie Kessler</a> of The Mercury in Pottstown, Pa., for leading a <a title="Pottstown Mercury engages bloggers in community food drive" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/pottstown-mercury-engages-bloggers-in-community-food-drive/">community food drive</a>. Kessler, also a finalist for <a title="Martin G. Reynolds honored as Innovator of the Year" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/bay-area-news-group/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/">Innovator of the Year</a>, has joined the York Daily Record&#8217;s staff.</li>
<li>The Oakland Tribune for its <a title="Oakland Voices" href="http://oaklandvoices.us/">Oakland Voices</a> project (part of the winning nomination for <a title="Martin G. Reynolds honored as Innovator of the Year" href="http://www.outsidethunderdome.com/spotlight/bay-area-news-group/martin-reynolds-honored-innovator-year/">Martin G. Reynolds as Innovator of the Year</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>After being informed of the NewsVroom selection as a DFMie winner, Managing Editor Randy Parker provided more detail on the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have racked up hundreds of miles on the NewsVroom. We have attended more than 60 events, and have dozens more scheduled. At this point, we do little to seek invitations. Rather, we try to avoid double- or triple-booking.</p>
<p>The Vroom has a proven track of moving the needle on specific mobile efforts. For instance, recently we noticed that few people had downloaded our very good Yard Sales PA mobile app. So on a Saturday, we held a &#8216;Vroom event at a community yard sale, taught people about the app, and saw the first day of double-digit downloads of the app.</p>
<p>Our GameTimePA mobile app sees spikes in the rate of downloads every time we attended high school sports events. we currently have about 8,000 downloads on the app. In May alone – a relatively slow month for such content, the app had 2,711 users racking up 202,461 page views.</p>
<p>Our next big push will come at the reenactment of the <a title="Gettysburg 150" href="http://www.ydr.com/gettysburg150">Battle of Gettysburg</a>. With up to 4 million visitors expected, our &#8216;Vroom team will show people the new<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gettysburg-150-facts-about/id646857431?mt=8"> iPad commemorative e-Magazine</a></span> we created for this event. And after that, the team will tout the new GameTimePA high school football preview iPad app.</p>
<p>NewsVroom on the blogs: Between <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/ydrinsider/">YDR Insider</a>, <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/varsity/">The Varsity Beat </a>and <a href="http://www.yorkblog.com/newsvroom/">The NewsVroom</a>, our staff has used a variety of blogs to tell people where the &#8216;Vroom will be, engage with them while we are there, and share stories and photos about our visits afterward.</p>
<p>NewsVroom on social media: We routinely use the &#8216;Vroom&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNewsVroom">Twitter </a>and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewsVroom">Facebook</a> accounts to promote events. But we also use them as educational playgrounds. Safe areas, as it were, for the community to learn how to engage with us. We also use any of our regular staff accounts to socialize &#8216;Vroom efforts.</p></blockquote>
