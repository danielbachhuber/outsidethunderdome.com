		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for asking, Ron. Our CEO, John Paton, has blogged about our business approach: http://jxpaton.wordpress.com. My focus is on content, but our AdTaxi Networks is an excellent example of thinking differently about revenue, and it&#039;s generating significant revenue to offset a large portion of the declining print revenue: http://www.adtaxinetworks.com/ Your use of cocaine as an analogy would be more appropriate if you had likened it to newspapers&#039; addiction to our former advertising and subscription revenue model. It doesn&#039;t fit the entrepreneurial challenges of disruption at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nelson, you identify an important challenge we will face in this process. We don&#039;t have all the answers yet, because the pilot newsrooms of Project Unbolt are an experimental experience. Our standard of accuracy doesn&#039;t change: We publish verified facts. And, while we&#039;d love to have the layers of editors we once had, the economic realities of today no longer support that and wishful thinking won&#039;t bring them back. 

Some of the important challenges we face in Project Unbolt will be deciding where and how to apply our editing resources, how to uphold standards in live reporting and how to make reporters more responsible for the quality of their work. These are valid issues that are already part of our planning. We&#039;ll report on our successes and mistakes as we address these matters. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is interesting, and a little overwhelming for those of us steeped in print forms. On the previous point. It appears that in the unbolted newsroom reporters are being asked, expected, to report directly from the scene of a news story. Over the years I have worked with reporters and interns of varying quality. It is just part of the business. The print editing process has a gate. Plenty of sloppy copy, poor reporting and errors have been stopped at that gate. I would like to hear a little more about the editing and vetting process in the unbolted newsroom. You send a young reporter to the scene. Before he or she begins tweeting away, is there some type of a deliberative process that is part of the current print model? 
Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re welcome to your point of view, but you might want to check your own credibility. We maintain the same standard of accuracy in live coverage as we do in print stories. If you&#039;re aware of errors we have not corrected in live coverage, please call them to the appropriate newsroom&#039;s attention. But I think if you actually study some of our live coverage, you&#039;ll find that your assumptions were what&#039;s lacking in credibility.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds sensible. We&#039;d love to help as you explore different mechanisms for making your community-powered workflows scaleable (we&#039;ve had some success at the college media level helping groups swarm around assignments with process - not chaos - guiding their work).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent suggestion, Roman! Community engagement is a huge part of our strategy and engaging with students will certainly be part of that. Probably not &quot;first,&quot; though. We&#039;re going to move ahead swiftly on multiple fronts, so lots of things will be happening at the same time.]]></description>
