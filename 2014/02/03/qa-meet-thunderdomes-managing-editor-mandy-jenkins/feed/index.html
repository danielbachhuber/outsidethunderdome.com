		<description><![CDATA[Janet, that&#039;s a good question. I think an unbolted newsroom should have a good calendar tool, so people can learn about community events. And we should provide advance coverage of newsworthy events. But that advance coverage, like everything, should start from a digital point of view: Perhaps a live chat in advance of a big event or maybe a Tout video as organizers are setting up for a fair or festival, etc. Maybe the advance coverage promotes an effort to engage the community in coverage of the event (submitting photos during the event or memories of past events for the advance coverage). Like everything else, we&#039;re going to experiment and try to learn the best ways. How do you think we should handle advance coverage?]]></description>
